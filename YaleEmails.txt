To the Yale Community,

Yesterday, the U.S. Department of Education released new regulations that reshape federal requirements for the way Yale and other educational institutions address sexual misconduct under Title IX.

These new regulations will prompt some changes to Yale’s sexual misconduct policies and procedures, but they will not change our fundamental philosophy: sexual misconduct is inimical to our community values. Our commitment to addressing sexual misconduct—to cultivating a culture of respect and inclusion where all members of our community can pursue their academic and professional aspirations—is unwavering.

For now, Yale’s current sexual misconduct policies and procedures remain in place. It is too soon to say exactly what changes we will make to align our policies and procedures with the new regulations. We and our colleagues across the country need to study the new federal rules in detail before we implement any changes to our process. Here in Connecticut, we may also need to adapt to new state requirements—the Connecticut legislature has already appointed a task force to review the federal regulations when issued, and its actions may shape our local options. The U.S. Department of Education has given schools until August 14 to comply with the new Title IX regulations.

What remains clear is that Yale will continue to prioritize sexual misconduct education, prevention, and response throughout our community. Our current policies, educational initiatives, and trainings have been carefully constructed; we will bring the same level of care to the task of aligning our processes with new federal and state mandates.  

Other elements that are already coming into focus:
The new Title IX regulations primarily appear to affect our formal disciplinary process. Some members of our community are concerned that the changes to our process required by these new regulations will deter survivors from pursuing formal complaints. We are confident that the university will continue to provide balance, fairness, and support to the parties in these cases, even as it adapts to the new regulations.
In past years, fewer than 10 percent of complainants chose to pursue a formal complaint. The vast majority of individuals who came forward instead sought supportive measures and accommodations, and the new regulations will not force complainants into formal processes that they do not wish to pursue. The Title IX Office, in collaboration with SHARE and the Yale Police Department, will continue to provide those services.
We have opportunities to expand our options for response. The new Title IX rules more clearly permit alternative modes of resolution such as mediation. Members of Yale’s Title IX Steering Committee have begun exploring this additional modality and other options that may have the potential to meet a broad range of individual and community needs.

We write this message in a time of obvious uncertainty and anxiety, and, for many of you, the impact of the new Title IX regulations may be another source of worry. Please trust that we will be making any necessary adjustments with thoughtfulness and care. We are dedicated to having an appropriate array of fair, supportive, effective processes to prevent sexual misconduct and to address it when it occurs.

In the meantime, please remember that the staff of the SHARE Center, the Title IX Office, the University-wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct, and the YPD continue to work with community members through phone, Zoom, email, and the LiveSafe app. You can access all of them through the Sexual Misconduct Response and Prevention website.

Dear Yale College students,

Many of you are aware that the U.S. Department of Education has been in the process of issuing new regulations for addressing sexual misconduct under Title IX. Yesterday, the final rule was published. Across the country, educators are reading these new regulations, identifying the parameters of what will need to change, and thinking about possibilities for next steps.

I write to emphasize what President Salovey and Vice Provost Spangler wrote to you earlier today: whatever changes these new regulations may bring, our commitment to preventing and addressing sexual misconduct holds firm. Across the university and within Yale College, we are dedicated to creating a campus culture where sexual misconduct has no place and where every community member can feel safe and respected.

As you will have learned in reading President Salovey's and Vice Provost Spangler's message, which contains more details, it is too soon to be able to identify exactly what will change. For now, all of our current policies and procedures remain in place. I will communicate with you again as I learn more.

Please remember the many resources that are always available to you, including the SHARE Center, the Title IX Coordinators, the University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct, and the Yale Police. My staff and I are always here for you, too.

Sincerely,

Dear Graduates,

As with many of you, my internal clock is set to follow the tempo of an academic year. In anticipation of today, the day on which we would have held Yale’s 319th commencement ceremony, I expected to feel intensely the disruption to the rhythm of our year. Instead, this morning, I feel gratitude and deeply connected to our community. When I think of you and all the ways you have demonstrated your conviction that together, we can solve great challenges and improve our nation and the world, I am proud and thankful.

In recent weeks, you have helped those in need, made innovative technological advances, started and led organizations to address the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, supported your families and friends, and continued with your studies. Despite a global disruption that has not been seen in generations, you overcame challenges and disappointments to share light and truth with the world. Like Yale students and alumni during other turbulent periods over the past three centuries, you have focused on the common good and exemplified the spirit and strength of our community.

Your actions during the COVID-19 pandemic are impressive, but they are only a small part of your accomplishments to date, so many of which have been spotlighted in profiles of our newest graduates of Yale College and the graduate and professional schools. I personally have had the privilege to witness your achievements in classrooms, at sporting events, in laboratories, on stages, and in countless other venues. Today, I am thinking of all you have added to our community and Yale’s history.

I look forward to the day when we can celebrate your accomplishments properly on campus. In the meantime, it is important for us to come together as a community in the ways we can to share our pride and appreciation for this milestone in your lives. As a tribute to you, I have recorded a speech for your graduation and the conferral of your degrees. I have also recognized this year’s honorary degree recipients, who will be invited to celebrate alongside you when it is safe for us to gather in person at Yale.

Until we see one another again on campus, know that I am immensely proud of you and that faculty and staff across the university are thinking of you on this joyous day. Congratulations to all our 2020 graduates!

Sincerely,

To the Yale College community,

I am delighted to announce that I have named Melanie Boyd as the Dean of Student Affairs and Senior Associate Dean in Yale College, starting June 1, 2020.

Dean Boyd has played many roles in the Yale College Dean's Office for over ten years. In 2009, she joined the YCDO as Special Assistant to the Dean for Gender Issues, and in 2011 she was named Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, focusing on creating a safe campus environment and promoting the values of respect, mutuality, and mindfulness. She has served as the acting director and director of the Alcohol and Other Drugs Harm Reduction Initiative, and as the founding director of the Office of Gender and Campus Culture she created the Community and Consent Program, overseeing the graduate students, student affairs fellows, and CCE educators charged with building a positive campus sexual climate.

Through her work, Dean Boyd has formed important partnerships within and beyond Yale College. She serves on the Title IX Steering Committee, which sets sexual misconduct policies, procedures, and prevention programs for all faculty, staff, and students. She also trains disciplinary board members, Title IX Coordinators, deans, faculty, student leaders, and other campus personnel. She serves as well on the Intercultural Affairs Council, supports broad Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion efforts across campus, and acts as an adviser to the Yale Women’s Center. She has also been a valued member of the Committee on Social Life and Community Values, the Restorative Justice Working Group, Yale Safety Net, and the Yale College Orientation Committee.

Dean Boyd earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale College, in Women’s Studies; a Master of Arts from Emory, also in Women's Studies; and a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, in English and Women's Studies. Her academic work and teaching focus on Feminist, Queer, and Critical Theory; Women's and Gender Studies; Contemporary Literature and Culture; Literary Theory; Sexual Violence, and Sexual Culture. She has presented and written widely on sexual climate, consent, and positive culture change on college campuses, in many cases with recognition from grants, fellowships, and awards. From 2007 to 2013, she taught as a lecturer in the Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program, and from 2009 to 2011 she served as its director of undergraduate studies.

As the Dean of Student Affairs, Dean Boyd will play a crucial role in promoting the values of our community. Her work will focus on developing and implementing a vision for a broad range of student-centered services that include campus climate, alcohol policies, student well-being, counseling, discipline, student organizations, housing, orientation, first-year counselors, and student activities. She will also support the residential college deans, and she will continue to serve as liaison to the Women’s Center and to participate as a member of the Provost’s Title IX Steering Committee. More generally, she will guide efforts that establish a positive, inclusive, and safe campus climate.

This appointment comes as the outcome of a national search that attracted a pool of extraordinary candidates from colleges and universities across the country. The search committee, led by Senior Associate Dean of Strategic Initiatives and Communications Paul McKinley, included students, a current residential college head and former residential college dean, and members of the Office of the Secretary and Vice President for Student Life. As the committee concluded its work, Dean McKinley reported that all finalists for the position brought tremendous experience, dedication, and vision with them. In the end, Dean Boyd stood out even among this exceptional list of candidates because of her long experience with Yale College, her outstanding record of collaborating with students and administrators alike, and her own vision for the position of Dean of Student Affairs.

For identifying such a strong candidate for the deanship, I would like to thank all the members of the search committee: Aliesa Bahri, MY '22; Gabbie DeSombre, BR '21; Andrew Dowe, Lecturer in Women's, Gender, & Sexuality Studies and Associate Director, Office of LGBTQ Resources; Andrew Forsyth, Strategic Advisor, University Life; Eileen Galvez, Director of La Casa Cultural and Assistant Dean in Yale College; Catherine Panter-Brick, Bruce A. and Davi-Ellen Chabner Professor of Anthropology, Health, and Global Affairs and Head of Morse College; Nilakshi Parndigamage, Project Manager of Academic Initiatives and former Dean of Ezra Stiles College; and Julie Sweigard, Senior Executive Assistant to the Dean of Yale College. I thank them for their service.

I hope you will join me in welcoming Dean Boyd to her new role.

Sincerely,

Dear students,

Earlier today, Provost Strobel provided the community with information about the fall calendar, modified to enable the university to plan for three possible scenarios for instruction: online, residential, and a hybrid.  In early July, President Salovey will announce the mode of instruction for the fall semester, following guidelines from state and medical authorities. Although many of the particulars still under review will be announced then, I can provide some today in order to keep you informed.

To make the best use of time for a residential scenario -- if President Salovey announces that the university will offer one --  the on-campus period will have no breaks for Labor Day or October recess, and it will end by November 20, the Friday before Thanksgiving week. Academic commitments after Thanksgiving will be online, and the campus will close to undergraduates.  Depending on the global health situation, emergency accommodations may be considered for students who may not be able to travel home at that time, as in this past spring.  

To ensure the community's safety in a residential scenario, everyone will need to observe social distancing and other health precautions, such as wearing a face mask.  In a residential scenario, the University will provide testing, contact-tracing, and other support to help with distancing in spaces for learning, housing, dining, social life, recreation, and sports.  It will also require you to limit your travel to and from New Haven.

Although the modified fall calendar makes the best use of time in a residential scenario, I realize that its absence of breaks brings new challenges. Whatever President Salovey announces in July, I will ask the faculty to be mindful of the calendar's constraints when they plan their assignments and assessments. I will also appoint a committee to consider wellness and mental health concerns.

Because  of the need for viral screening tests, a residential scenario will also require a staged return to campus over several days, beginning August 24, a reopening date set by the governor of Connecticut. This schedule does not allow time to host pre-orientation programs on campus, and as a result they will be offered online before the term starts, with any in-person programming scheduled after school starts.

The particulars of any online or hybrid scenario are still under review, but their goals include accommodating students who are quarantined or immunosuppressed, international students who may be delayed in obtaining their visas, and anyone not able to be on campus and, where feasible, enabling students on campus to take a combination of courses in person and online.  

Some of you may be considering taking a leave of absence, and you will  have an opportunity to decide after the July announcement. Even so, I will provide as much information as possible before then, drawing on recommendations from groups that are developing contingency plans to ensure excellence in your academics and student life. (You can find more information about them here and here).  These groups – many of which include Yale College Council representatives – are addressing questions of how social distancing requirements would affect classroom learning, residential living, and social activities.  I look forward to receiving their recommendations.

In the meantime, the process to retrieve your belongings will begin in June. The Yale College Council has shared your questions and concerns about it, and after conferring with the move-out coordinating team, I will write to you in a separate message.  

Sincerely,

Marvin M. Chun

Dear Members of the Yale Community,

I write to you today deeply upset by the killing of George Floyd while he was in the custody of Minneapolis police officers. Mr. Floyd’s death follows a pattern of racial injustice that has become too familiar in our country and that amounts to a national emergency.

At a time when the American community must come together more than ever before, George Floyd’s horrifying death shocks our shared conscience and indicts our shared failure. It can and must remind us of other similar killings and of the racism, nativism, and bigotry too pervasive in society today and throughout our country’s history.

Over the past week, I have been thinking about two seemingly incongruous things—our sense of community and one of our most basic emotions: fear.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, legitimate fear has been very much with us, but not just about the virus itself, and not among us equally. From reports of racism against people of Asian descent to the unacceptable disparities in health outcomes and health care, there was every reason for us to fear for the safety of our neighbors and family members, and of some, sadly, more than of others.

At the same time, I saw nurses, doctors, support staff, and volunteers act with courage, selflessness, and compassion in our home city and around the world. We nurtured a growing sense of community, which gave us the optimism and hope that must ever be a cornerstone of our beloved country. It is in the face of that noble expression of solidarity that George Floyd’s death has shaken us and the shared spirit of heroism we have aroused to fight the pandemic.

As I read the news reports of Mr. Floyd’s death and its explosive response, I know that many members of our community feel fear in their daily lives because of the injustices they have experienced and witnessed, and I thought of how fear so reliably leads to anxiety, depression, health deterioration, and anger, and also to aggression and even violence. Some of the protests have turned destructive, undermining the plea for justice all Americans must share. Fear is powerful, damaging, and unpredictable in its effects.

I believe that all of us at Yale must do what we can to replace fear with hope—and not with anything less than action. Here I have been thinking much of the life of the extraordinary Pauli Murray, a lawyer, civil rights leader, and Yale Law School graduate. She experienced firsthand the cruelties of racial segregation and suffered injustices. She knew fear. However, she wrote in her memoir, “Seeing the relationship between my personal cause and the universal cause of freedom released me from a sense of isolation…I would be no less afraid to challenge the system of racial segregation, but the heightened significance of my cause would impel me to act in spite of my fears.”

I have implored myself—and earnestly invite you to do the same— to make direct use of Pauli Murray’s wisdom. Her words remind us of all that we have been able to accomplish together because of our shared commitment to the common good. Since mid-March, we have saved lives in this pandemic. We have isolated ourselves, changed the way we live, and sacrificed to safeguard the well-being of the most vulnerable among us and prevent our hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. It is vital to remember that we have been united in easing suffering, improving lives, and providing hope during a turbulent and challenging period of our history. If we can do this, we are capable, all of us, of creating the America we must insist belongs to us all.

In 1945, Pauli Murray wrote, “As an American I inherit the magnificent tradition of an endless march toward freedom and toward the dignity of all mankind.” We have so much more to do to foster and sustain an equitable society. Instead of feeling the isolating effects of fear when our sense of community is shaken, we must remember that we are connected in more ways than we are divided. And that where we are divided, we must work, now, in the interest of unity and justice. This is a matter of the highest importance.

So, let us act as Pauli Murray would have us act toward those we know well but also those to whom we are connected simply by a common and powerful dream. I am grateful that you and I share Yale and its mission to improve the world today and for future generations. In looking forward to the work we have ahead of us, I wish you peace and strength.

With best wishes for your health and safety,

Dear students,

You will be receiving more information later today about retrieving your belongings. You also have the option to leave them on campus for pickup in the fall, if Yale announces in July that it will offer a residential fall term. I am grateful to all the staff members at Conferences and Events who are organizing this immensely complex project. They are working as hard as they can, under severe constraints, to reunite you with your belongings while at the same time protecting the community's health.  

Seniors were given priority in a pilot program last week, and their feedback helped refine the process to be more flexible and accommodating. Thanks to them, additional slots were added during evenings and weekends, and in late June and July. Two-hour slots, the default, enable the staff to accommodate the most students, safely and efficiently; a small percentage of seniors requested three-hour slots. All the new slots are now available in the reservation system. 

I am very grateful to you for your patience and understanding during this historic undertaking, even as I recognize that it will require adjustments and refinements. If you have other needs, please communicate with the staff members of the Office of Conferences and Events so that they can know how best to serve you while they safeguard everyone’s health. They and I understand how important your belongings are to you, and we will do our best to help you retrieve them. 

Sincerely,

July 1, 2020

Dear Members of the Yale Community,

We are writing to report plans for fall 2020. We know you have been waiting patiently for the information provided here, in the attached links, and in communications you will receive from others shortly. These plans adhere to the advice of public health experts, reflect input from Yale’s COVID-19 Contingency Planning Committees, and are in accordance with Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont’s roadmap for reopening Connecticut.

Yale will welcome graduate and professional school students and a portion of the undergraduate population back to campus for the fall semester. Nearly all Yale College courses will be taught remotely, so that all undergraduate students can enroll. Graduate and professional schools will offer different combinations of in-person and remote teaching. We also will continue our reactivation of on-site research and many other university operations with strict health precautions in place. These decisions are possible because of the continued decline in community transmission of COVID-19 in Connecticut, the creation of a university-wide COVID-19 screening program, and the implementation of other health and safety actions.

Now more than ever, the world needs the very best from Yale. We state in our goals for the institution that Yale aspires to be “the research university most committed to teaching and learning” and to “provide an unsurpassed campus learning environment that cultivates innovators, leaders, pioneers, creators, and entrepreneurs in all fields and for all sectors of society.” With great care for everyone’s well-being, we must do all that we can to continue to create knowledge and educate the next generation.

All of us are sacrificing as part of a community dedicated to reducing the risk of spreading COVID-19. Although the rates of COVID-19 hospitalization and death have declined in Connecticut, this pandemic is not over. The public health crisis continues to demand self-discipline, personal responsibility, prioritizing the common good over individual preferences, a spirit of cooperation, and resilience. The Yale community rises to every challenging time with spirit and optimism, and we know this moment will not be different.  

In order to reduce the spread of COVID-19, we must substantially limit many activities in the fall. We include some details below, and students, faculty, and staff will receive particulars from deans and other university leaders in the coming days. We are updating the university’s COVID-19 website regularly with information for all members of the community. In addition, we will soon send an invitation to a town hall meeting, at which we can share these plans more fully and address your questions.

IN-RESIDENCE EDUCATION FOR YALE COLLEGE

Although in-residence education for Yale College students will not look like typical college life in the next academic year, we will create the best possible learning environment in the context of this public health crisis. We must be aware that social distancing, wearing face coverings, and other precautions have reduced COVID-19 spread in Connecticut, but thousands of new cases of the disease are reported weekly across the country. We have a responsibility to continue to do our part to control this pandemic as we resume teaching and learning in the fall.

Some undergraduates will have the option to return to campus

For each semester in 2020-2021, three classes of students will be in residence. We encourage students who cannot return to campus to continue their Yale education remotely. For fall 2020, first-year students, juniors, and seniors will have the option to live in residential colleges and other campus housing. For spring 2021, sophomores, juniors, and seniors can choose to live on campus. This arrangement allows the university to decrease the undergraduate student population living in the colleges to about 60 percent of normal and lower the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Yale College Dean Marvin Chun will provide additional information about how first-year students and sophomores who enroll for the coming fall and spring semesters will be able to take two courses in Yale Summer Session in 2021 under a special arrangement that waives tuition for two credits. He also will announce guidelines on taking a leave of absence or gap year for those who prefer these options. In addition, the provost announced in May that we will be following a modified academic calendar to allow students to complete in-person educational programs by Thanksgiving break.

Undergraduate courses will mostly be conducted remotely

As has been the case since the beginning of the pandemic, our plans are guided by considerations for the health and safety of students, faculty, staff, and neighbors. We will be implementing social distancing measures for all courses. The fall semester will require self-discipline and a focus on the well-being of others, especially those who are most vulnerable to COVID-19.

For most lectures and seminars—as well as other small-format courses such as writing classes and introductory language classes—the bulk of instruction will be conducted remotely. There will be both synchronous and asynchronous components. Wherever feasible, such courses will have associated in-person supplements. For a small number of classes, such as those involving laboratory or studio work that cannot be conducted remotely, instruction will take place in person, in socially distanced settings.

GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL COURSES AND RESIDENTIAL LIVING

Most of Yale’s graduate and professional students live off campus, making it possible to welcome back all who can study and conduct research on campus. We recognize that some students cannot return to campus due to travel or health restrictions, so most courses will be taught remotely. Some will be conducted in-person with social distancing requirements in place. Using a mix of online and in-person courses maximizes our options for students to return to campus and for adhering to public health guidelines. The deans of each school will send additional details.

To lower the risk of spreading COVID-19, Yale housing for graduate and professional students will require reduced occupancy, social distancing in common areas, and other restrictions.

RESUMING RESEARCH AND OTHER OPERATIONS ON CAMPUS FOR FACULTY, STAFF, AND TRAINEES

As a global research university, we have a responsibility to ask deep questions about ourselves and the world. In May, the provost announced three phases of research reactivation, which brought back a limited number of faculty, staff, and trainees to campus starting June 1. We will begin phase 2 on July 20 and expect to enter phase 3 of research reactivation on August 24. Many research activities will resume, while observing strict health and safety precautions.

We encourage anyone who can do their work from home to continue to do so. Consistent with the guidance from the State of Connecticut, individuals over the age of 65 or who are at higher risk for severe illness should continue to work from home when possible.

As research and teaching activities expand in the coming weeks, managers will inform staff when they are needed on campus. We are committed to supporting our community during this unprecedented public health crisis, and Senior Vice President for Operations Jack Callahan Jr. will provide more specific guidance to staff and managers soon.

COVID-19 TESTING AND OTHER PRECAUTIONS

The substantial reduction in the rates of COVID-19 hospitalization, death, and infection in Connecticut is directly related to the precautions taken on campus, in the City of New Haven, and in the state for the past several months. To sustain positive public health trends in our region, each of us must continue to maintain at least six feet of distance from others, wear a mask or other face covering when in public places, self-monitor for COVID-19 symptoms, wash our hands frequently, and adhere to other precautions. Each member of the community plays a critical role in preventing the spread of COVID-19. All students, faculty, and staff must commit to following health guidelines and setting an example for their peers.

The requirements below are based on current public health guidance and state rules. Because government officials may need to adjust their policies based on the conditions in our region, these requirements may be updated in the coming months. We will keep you informed of any changes and will update the COVID-19 website continually.

Mandatory training and public health guidelines

All faculty, staff, and students returning to campus will be required to complete online informational programming. All undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students returning to campus must review, sign, and follow the Yale Community Compact, which describes social distancing, viral testing, and health and hygiene guidelines. We also encourage everyone to review regularly the full list of health measures.

The Yale COVID-19 Screening Program

COVID-19 testing for students

To reduce the transmission of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 among students who are coming to New Haven from many different locations, viral testing and other precautions will be required of all students returning to campus.
All undergraduate students (whether living on or off campus) will be tested upon arrival to campus and will be required to undergo viral testing weekly throughout the semester.
Graduate and professional school students living in university dormitory-style housing will be tested upon arrival to campus and will be required to undergo viral testing weekly throughout the semester.
Graduate and professional students living off campus will be required to undergo viral testing once at the start of the fall semester. Additional testing is available if required by academic programs involving direct patient care or if a student has concerns about exposure.
All students arriving from abroad or from states with high prevalence of COVID-19 will quarantine for 14 days as required by the State of Connecticut. You can find the current list of states on Connecticut’s travel advisory webpage.
Students who live in residential colleges or university dormitory-style housing and receive positive test results will isolate in separate university housing for at least 14 days and until Yale Health informs them it is safe to stop isolation. They will receive medical care and be able to take classes remotely.
Students who live off campus and receive positive test results will be asked to isolate at home for at least 14 days and until Yale Health informs them it is safe to return to campus. They will receive medical care and be able to take classes remotely.
Close contacts of students who test positive will be asked to quarantine for 14 days. They will be able to take classes remotely. The identity of the individual testing positive will not be shared with contacts.
Yale Health will provide medical care as necessary for any student who becomes symptomatic with COVID-19.

COVID-19 testing for faculty, staff, and post-doctoral trainees

All faculty, as well as student-facing staff and post-doctoral trainees, who will be on campus during the fall term will be required to be tested for COVID-19 at the start of the semester. Staff and post-doctoral trainees who do not interact with students are encouraged, but are not required, to be tested for COVID-19 at the start of the semester. Depending on their Yale duties, a limited number of faculty and staff may be required to be tested for COVID-19 weekly. Other asymptomatic individuals who feel they may be at risk for COVID-19 may seek additional testing through Yale’s COVID-19 Screening Program. Faculty, staff, and post-doctoral trainees who test positive will be asked to self-isolate at home for at least 14 days and until a health care provider informs them it is safe to return to campus.

Enhanced cleaning and disinfection protocols

Yale’s facilities team will clean and disinfect buildings thoroughly prior to reopening them. The team will disinfect public spaces and commonly touched surfaces throughout the day. Hand sanitizers will be available at numerous locations within all occupied buildings. We are augmenting cleaning protocols to sustain good workplace hygiene.

TRAVEL, EVENTS AND GROUP GATHERINGS, AND VISITORS TO CAMPUS

Travel outside of Connecticut will be discouraged

Although health conditions may be improving in parts of the country and the world, we are still in a pandemic. To do our part in limiting the spread of COVID-19, travel outside of Connecticut is discouraged for faculty and staff for the duration of this public health crisis. Undergraduates may travel only for emergencies or with approval from their residential college deans’ offices for travel that is essential for educational or personal reasons. The university strongly urges graduate and professional students to limit their travel. Everyone should wear masks or other face coverings and practice social distancing to the greatest extent possible while traveling.

Travelers returning from abroad or any state with a high prevalence of COVID-19 must be tested for COVID-19 and self-quarantine for 14 days. Other domestic travelers are encouraged to be tested through the Yale COVID-19 Screening Program upon return.

Events and group gatherings will be limited

If possible, Yale events should be hosted remotely. In-person classes, meetings, and social gatherings in the fall will be limited. Performances will not be held, and meal service will be substantially modified to eliminate crowded dining rooms. The Ivy League will announce a decision about fall athletic competition on July 8. Yale Athletics will provide updates.

We will track carefully state and public health guidance on events and group gatherings, and keep you informed through the COVID-19 website.

Visits to campus will be limited

To reduce the risk of bringing cases of COVID-19 to campus, the university will not allow short-term visitors (anyone staying on campus for less than a full semester) in the fall term. The Visitor Center will remain closed. Deans will be providing instructions on how parents and guardians may bring students to campus.

We will require scholars and students who plan to visit campus for the full fall semester to follow all university policies and public health guidelines. Visiting scholars and students must be tested for COVID-19 upon arriving on campus.

We will review these limits in mid-November if prevailing state rules or public health guidance changes. More information is available at the COVID-19 website.

CONTINUED MONITORING OF COVID-19 AND PUBLIC HEALTH CONDITIONS

The pandemic is a dynamic situation—developments in the prevalence of the virus, the availability of treatment, or guidance from government officials may require changes in announced policies. Yale’s Public Health Committee will continue to track infection and hospitalization rates and monitor developments in public health policies and recommended practices.

We are prepared for different scenarios, including a possible resurgence of infections later in the fall that could lead to a change in campus activities. Yale’s modified academic calendar for the fall will help to mitigate the effects of a potential second wave of COVID-19, as the last week of instruction, reading period, and final exam period will be conducted remotely. Our colleagues will be in regular touch with you about any relevant changes in public health conditions or guidelines.
 
***

We take this opportunity to thank the members of the COVID-19 Contingency Planning Committees for their hard work, thoughtful deliberations, and detailed recommendations. And we thank all of you for sustaining Yale’s core mission over the last several months, whether through teaching and learning online, reactivating research, or maintaining campus operations. Our ability to work together despite great challenges has brought us to this moment in pandemic planning. And, as a community, we can emerge with our core mission and ability to pursue it stronger than ever.

This turbulent period in our nation and around the world demonstrates that there are more questions than answers in solving pressing challenges, in mitigating conflict, and in creating a world where all can thrive. We must approach our work—to create and share knowledge that benefits humanity and to prepare leaders of insight and integrity—with a renewed sense of purpose. There is a lot for us to do, and together, we will bring light and truth to a country and a world that need both.

With best wishes for your health and safety,

Dear returning students,

Now that President Salovey and Provost Strobel have announced the university's plans for returning to campus, you have a good overview of what to expect as you start thinking about the fall. If you haven't already, I urge you to read their message carefully, along with the resources they include, and discuss it with your parents and guardians. As you can see, great care has gone into promoting your and the community's health and safety, enabling you to pursue your education, and providing you with options as you start thinking about whether or how to enroll in the fall. Next week you will receive instructions for communicating your plans, which I ask that you submit by July 20.

So many of you, I know, have been looking forward to being on campus, and I am so pleased to tell you that this is possible. Although some of you are managing personal, travel, or health constraints, you all are invited, but not required, to be on campus for at least part of the coming year. As you consider which option is right for you, keep in mind that some of what you have anticipated will be waiting for you on campus, and some will be modified in order to protect everyone's health and maintain equity. Much more information is available in the FAQs, so please study them before you communicate your fall-term plans by July 20. They provide more detail about what follows below, and more, but start by keeping these ideas in mind as you think about next semester.
You will be required to protect your and others’ health
If you decide to return to Yale, whether you will be living on campus or off, you will need to complete a training program and agree to abide by the commitment set out in a community compact, which will be enforced because of its importance for public health. You will also be required to have a viral test when you arrive, then regularly throughout the term, and to follow any quarantine or self-isolation protocols that apply to you. You will be expected to limit your travel outside Connecticut, and to follow sensible rules around social distancing, wearing face coverings, and hand washing.
Most classes will be conducted online, and all of them evaluated with the usual grading policy
For all students, on or off campus, seminars and sections will be held online but live, while lectures, which will also be held online, may be live or recorded. Some courses that depend on labs, studios, or collections may be offered in person but with enrollments small enough to allow for social distancing. Students enrolled in Yale College courses will be evaluated according to the college’s usual grading policies, not a universal pass/fail system. The faculty and staff are devoting themselves to providing the best possible courses online and are incorporating feedback from last semester's and this summer's online courses.
Three classes will be on campus at the same time
Seniors and juniors will be able to study on campus in both the fall and the spring if they choose. First-year students will be able to study on campus in the fall and sophomores in the spring, with the option and encouragement to be enrolled and studying remotely during their respective semesters away from campus. Students whose home environments do not support remote learning may request permission to be on campus both semesters. Sharing access to campus between the first-year and sophomore classes makes it possible for all four classes to be on campus for at least part of the year and makes social distancing possible in campus housing. First-year students and sophomores who enroll for both the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semesters, with at least one term taken remotely, will be eligible to take two courses in Yale Summer Session in the summer of 2021 under a special arrangement that covers tuition; additional financial support for on-campus room and board will be available that summer to eligible first-year students and sophomores who also receive financial aid.
All on-campus housing will use single bedrooms
If you will be living on campus, you will have a single bedroom to yourself. With three classes on campus at one time instead of four, the density in all campus housing will be reduced in order to make social distancing possible and give you privacy to participate in classes online. If you are a returning student and made on-campus housing arrangements last spring, they will be reconfigured to make single-bedroom housing available for everyone, with every effort made to preserve rooming groups. The usual fee to relinquish housing will be waived for all students, and if you wish to live in campus housing, you must request it by July 20 when you communicate your fall-term plans.
Residential life and dining will be adapted for social distancing
In the colleges, you can expect all your interactions to follow social distancing guidelines; large group events to be conducted remotely or postponed; and indoor gatherings to be capped in order to comply with public health guidelines. Group size limits will likely increase or decrease depending on the prevailing health situation and guidance from the state. Service hours in the dining halls will be expanded in order to ease congestion during peak demand, and you will also have options for pre-ordered and grab-and-go meals. Common spaces will accommodate fewer people.
Co-curricular and in-person activities will also be adapted for social distancing 
Being on campus of course makes it possible to see or make friends in person, even with social distancing guidelines in place. And whether you will be on campus or off, many activities will be able to continue online. Keep in mind, though, that all spaces on campus will have reduced capacity, so in-person group activities will be curtailed, and activities that cannot be conducted with appropriate social distancing, such as dramatic performances, undergraduate productions, singing groups, and some other musical groups will have to be reimagined to take place online. A decision about varsity athletics has not been determined yet, but many intramural sports are expected to be canceled. And although college gyms and dance studios will be closed until public health guidelines allow them to reopen, Payne Whitney Gymnasium and other athletic facilities will be open with limits on capacity in order to preserve social distancing.
You have options
Thanks to the efforts of the faculty, the residential college heads and deans, Yale's public health advisers, the staff, and the Yale College Council, you will be able to be on campus with your classmates, but you have the flexibility to remain enrolled and learn remotely, without returning to campus. You may also request a leave of absence, for one or two terms; leaves in 2020-2021 will not count toward the usual two-term limit on leaves. And of course you can choose to come to campus, a place that holds deep meaning for so many of you and where you are all supported and welcome.

I thank you all for your patience and understanding as you have waited to learn about the university's plans. We here on campus are thinking of you and doing everything we can, despite the pandemic's disruptions, to ensure that you can get the best of Yale.

Dear seniors and juniors,

I know that many of you have been thinking about your options about returning to campus, and I hope that the messages you received July 1 from President Salovey, Provost Strobel, and me provided you with some useful information for your planning. Many of you still have questions about the coming school year, and as more information becomes available you will be able to find it on Yale College's FAQ page. In particular, if you are studying on an F-1 visa or are a student athlete, you might be especially affected by recent developments and may still be uncertain about the fall semester. I am very mindful of the challenges many of you face in deciding how to proceed, and my colleagues and I are committed to supporting you all.

I do ask that you communicate your plans by July 20, even if they are tentative, in a survey that follows, so that the university can provide you with housing if you need it, make any necessary adjustments to your term bill and financial aid package, and better understand the needs of the entire student body. I understand that your plans may not yet be definite, so I ask that you respond to the survey to the best of your ability, keeping in mind that you may relinquish housing later without incurring any financial penalty and can request a leave of absence until September 14, also without financial penalty. But in order to request housing, whether or not you have a current housing assignment, and in order to receive accurate financial information, July 20 is the deadline.
Take the survey
The survey will ask you to indicate if you plan to enroll in residence, enroll remotely, or take a leave of absence. It will also ask where you plan to live in the fall of 2020 -- on campus, locally around campus within commuting distance, or elsewhere. If you plan to enroll in residence, keep in mind that housing is being reassigned in order to reduce density, not by reopening housing lotteries or room draws but centrally by the office of student affairs, wherever possible keeping rooming configurations intact or close together and in no case making new combinations without consultation with you. If you respond to the survey by saying that you plan to enroll in residence, you will receive further information by early August about next year's rooming configurations.

If you need more information in order to complete the survey, please write to yale.college@yale.edu, using the subject line "survey question." Thank you for completing it by July 20, and thank you for your continued patience and understanding.

With best wishes,

To the Yale Community,

Earlier today, Marta Kuzma, Stavros Niarchos Foundation Dean of the Yale School of Art, announced that she plans to complete her five-year term as dean on June 30, 2021, and transition full-time to the faculty of the school as a tenured professor of art. I support her decision. I know how committed she is to creating and sharing ways of shaping the world through art, and I am happy that she will continue to teach and engage in scholarship at the school.

Marta brought to Yale immense expertise in forging intellectual connections among students and faculty from diverse fields. Over the past four years, she leveraged her experiences and relationships in Europe and the United States to form multidisciplinary collaborations for the school. For example, she helped to establish the Art and Justice Initiative, which provides seminars, workshops, research projects, and teaching opportunities. Through the initiative, students have developed their own curricula to teach incarcerated youths in Connecticut and have explored solutions for climate change and sustainable farming with experts across campus.

A devoted educator, Marta has said that her greatest moments at Yale have involved imparting knowledge to and learning from the next generation of artists and scholars. Every fall, she teaches a course for Masters of Fine Arts students called “Diving into the Wreck.” With the help of visiting faculty members and other experts from across disciplines, she and her students examine their experiences as individuals and as members of dynamic communities. From human sexuality to racial and socioeconomic inequality, she promotes open and critical discourse about complex and challenging topics and how they relate to making and understanding art. She demonstrates to students how to bring to the open underlying challenges that we must understand before we can create a better future.

Marta also has worked steadfastly on recruiting preeminent faculty, scholars, and artists to the school. She enriched the school’s curriculum and research excellence by recruiting two award-winning faculty members, and she brought two renowned artists to the school as Presidential Visiting Scholars to enhance teaching, learning, and practice.

In July 2016, when Marta assumed the deanship of the School of Art, she became the first woman to do so in the school’s history. As we commemorate the 150th anniversary of coeducation at Yale, we recognize that when the art school was founded in 1869, it was the first program to welcome women students. It led the way for other schools at our university to embrace coeducation. Today the School of Art continues to guide and inspire conversations and actions that improve the world. In honor of the school’s legacy, Marta has partnered with trailblazing alumni to publish a book of essays dedicated to the history of women and gender nonconforming graduates and faculty at the Yale School of Art.

At the start of the fall semester, I will formalize the process for finding Marta’s successor. I will appoint a search advisory committee that will seek broad input from art school faculty, students, staff, and alumni. In addition, I will engage a search firm to assist in this process.

As a scholar, writer, educator, and leader, Marta has contributed immensely to encouraging individuals from all walks of life to engage with the arts to deepen their understanding of the world and to address pressing challenges. Please join me in extending our gratitude to Marta for her contributions as the dean of the School of Art.

Dear sophomores, juniors, and seniors,

If you have not yet responded to the survey that asks you to communicate your plans for the fall semester, please remember to do so before July 20 so that you will receive any necessary adjustments to your term bill and financial aid package, and to request housing if you need it. 

The survey will ask you to indicate if you plan to enroll in residence, enroll remotely, or take a leave of absence. You can find more information about these options and other updates on Yale College's FAQ page. 

Please note that if you plan to take a leave of absence, you must officially request one, separately from responding to the survey. You can make that request by clicking here.

If you plan to enroll remotely or take a leave, please keep a few things in mind:
You are strongly advised not to come to New Haven or interact with the campus community.
You will not have access to campus, with the exception of the health center.
You will not have access to in-person, on-campus jobs or research, part-time or full-time, paid or unpaid, although you are eligible for remote work and research.
You will not have access to routine testing.
Please understand that these restrictions are not meant to be punitive; they are part of the planning for public safety, which depends on reducing the density of students on campus and around New Haven.

If you have already taken the survey but need to change an answer, you may take it again; only your most recent submission will be used before the survey closes.

The survey closes at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on July 20. Here is the link.

As a separate reminder, if you have not responded to messages from Yale Conferences & Events (YC&E) about your belongings on campus, please do so now in order to help with preparations on campus. You can also find answers to frequently asked questions about belongings on the FAQ page maintained by YC&E.

Dear Members of the Yale Community,

In May, we wrote to you about the U.S. Department of Education’s new Title IX regulations, which go into effect on August 14. Since that time, we have been working with colleagues at Yale and across the country to understand the full implications of these federal requirements for the way educational institutions address sexual misconduct under Title IX.

We write today to update you on how Yale will implement the new federal rules in its procedures for investigating and adjudicating formal complaints. First and foremost, we remain committed to a process that both complies with the law and reflects the input, experiences, and principles of our community. We will continue to prioritize educational programs for prevention and to raise awareness of sexual misconduct and of university resources for support.

Accordingly, we have maintained many features that have formed the foundation of our response to sexual misconduct in the past. For example, all conduct that was prohibited under Yale’s previous policies is still prohibited, our definition of affirmative consent is unchanged, and our standard of proof in formal proceedings remains a preponderance of the evidence. Additionally, nothing in the regulations or in our policies going forward will diminish Title IX coordinators’ ability to provide supportive measures and accommodations to members of our community who have been affected by sexual misconduct. In addition, none of the changes will have an impact on the SHARE Center’s provision of confidential counseling and advice.

To accommodate changes in federal regulations, Yale has revised the procedures used by the University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct (UWC) to address formal complaints. For example, prior to a hearing, parties will have access to a larger body of evidence. A hearing officer with legal training will sit with members of the UWC to run the federally mandated hearing process and help decide cases.

Some members of our community have expressed concerns that the formal procedures required by the new federal rules could dissuade individuals from seeking the support and accommodation that are essential to the purpose of Title IX. We are addressing this potential problem both by strengthening existing resources, including services provided by Title IX coordinators and SHARE, and by exploring alternative models of resolving sexual misconduct complaints, such as restorative justice processes and, where appropriate, mediated resolutions.  

Like other universities across the country, our community has implemented the requirements of the new regulations during a challenging time in which we have all been grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure that we are being as careful as possible, we will adjust aspects of our procedures as we learn from experience and hear your views. (Please send your perspectives and questions to titleix@yale.edu.)

We remain committed to our community-centered approach not only in optimizing the fairness and effectiveness of Yale’s sexual misconduct procedures but also in striving to prevent the occurrence of behavior that harms our colleagues and students and is antithetical to the mission of our university. We invite you to review the revised procedures and to provide comments and suggestions to Yale’s Title IX Office (titleix@yale.edu). We also encourage you to participate in activities that will be scheduled in the upcoming academic year to share ideas on how we can combat sexual misconduct. It is only by working together that we can create and maintain a campus where everyone feels safe and respected and can take advantage of all that Yale has to offer.

Sincerely,

Dear Members of the Yale Community,

Earlier today, the Department of Justice informed Yale of its allegation that Yale’s undergraduate admissions practices discriminate on the basis of race, particularly in regard to Asian American and white applicants. As you may recall, the department began an investigation in 2018, when other universities were facing legal challenges that aimed to overturn Supreme Court precedent permitting the consideration of race in college admissions.

Yale has been fully cooperating with the DOJ investigation. We have produced large quantities of documents and data, and we are continuing to do so. However, the DOJ concluded its investigation before reviewing and receiving all the information it has requested.

The department’s allegation is baseless. Given our university’s commitment to complying with federal law, I am dismayed that the DOJ inexplicably rushed to conclude its investigation without conducting a fully informed analysis, which would have shown that Yale’s practices absolutely comply with decades of Supreme Court precedent.

Yale College will not change its admissions processes in response to today’s letter because the DOJ is seeking to impose a standard that is inconsistent with existing law. We will continue to look at the whole person when selecting whom to admit among the many thousands of highly qualified applicants. We will continue to look at what students have accomplished and hope to contribute to Yale and the world. We will continue to create a student body that is rich in a diverse range of ideas, expertise, and experiences. Such a student body greatly enhances students’ academic experiences and maximizes their future success. By bringing people of different backgrounds, talents, and perspectives together, we best prepare our students for a complex and dynamic world.

Yale’s admissions practices help us realize our mission to improve the world today and for future generations. At this unique moment in our history, when so much attention properly is being paid to issues of race, Yale will not waver in its commitment to educating a student body whose diversity is a mark of its excellence.

Dear Members of the Yale Community,

As announced on July 1, we are reactivating a residential college education for a portion of our undergraduates, welcoming all of our graduate and professional school students back to campus, and ramping up research activities and other university operations. I look forward to the start of this extraordinary academic year.

Over the summer, teams of faculty and staff members have worked around the clock to realize a thoughtful set of plans for fall 2020. From implementing the best technology available for wide-ranging teaching needs to initiating enhanced cleaning procedures and rigorous testing protocols, we are prepared to meet the challenges of creating and sharing knowledge in the coming semester.

To our students, especially first years and sophomores in Yale College, thank you for your willingness to be flexible. The fall semester will be different from anything experienced by our community. Despite the changes to how we teach, learn, and interact, we will continue to realize Yale’s mission to improve “the world today and for future generations through outstanding research and scholarship, education, preservation, and practice.” Carrying out this mission is more urgent than ever—even as we confront a virus whose resilience tests our own.

Together, we will make the fall semester the best it can be. Together, we will educate the next generation, provide solutions to pressing challenges, and ask questions about our world. Together, we will establish new ways to conduct research, share knowledge, and connect with one another. Every obstacle we overcome makes us more capable of addressing the next challenge.

When Provost Scott Strobel and I announced Yale’s plans for fall 2020, we noted that we will be tracking factors external to the university that affect our operations. We have been monitoring the prevalence of COVID-19 in our region and across the country, as well as attendant regulations from government officials and agencies. I provide, below, updates about current public health conditions in Connecticut, Yale’s preparations for the fall, and the university’s COVID-19 testing requirements. Because of encouraging public health trends in the state, our ability to test members of our community frequently and with acceptable turnaround time for results, and the outstanding planning by hundreds of faculty and staff across the university, I am pleased to be able to move forward with our announced plans.

Public health conditions in Connecticut

Connecticut continues to report some of the lowest rates of COVID-19 transmission, hospitalization, and mortality in the country. Overall, there has been a decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases in the state since April, and Connecticut’s rate of positive test results has been about 1 percent since late June.

The status of hospitalization for COVID-19 in our region is encouraging as well. As I write this, in the entire Yale New Haven Health System, comprising five hospitals, there are only seventeen inpatients with COVID-19. That number peaked at 787 back in April.

Connecticut’s public health improvements are due in large part to the excellent leadership of Governor Ned Lamont, his advisors and staff, and to strict adherence to social distancing, wearing face coverings, regular handwashing, and self-monitoring for symptoms by the residents of the state. The state’s auspicious COVID-19 situation speaks to the tremendous power of these behaviors.

As Yale welcomes students back to campus, we have a responsibility to sustain and not compromise these efforts to mitigate the spread of the disease. Students returning to campus must review, sign, and follow the Yale Community Compact, which describes health protective policies to which everyone must adhere. And faculty and staff must commit to following a complementary set of guidelines. I know that each of us will live up to our responsibilities to one another.

Applying what we have learned from reactivating research on campus over the summer

Since the beginning of June, many faculty, staff, and graduate and professional school students have returned to campus to continue their research, scholarship, and studies. To help prevent the transmission of the disease, Yale launched the COVID-19 testing program to test asymptomatic individuals as they resumed onsite work and study. Of the 5,303 asymptomatic students, faculty, and staff tested to date, seven (0.1 percent) were COVID-19 positive. Those individuals who tested positive were promptly notified, instructed to isolate, provided with care instructions, and connected to Yale’s contact tracing team.  

We have been able to prevent community spread of the coronavirus at Yale because faculty, staff, and students on campus this summer were extremely serious about wearing their masks, not gathering in groups, maintaining social distance, and washing their hands. In addition, our dedicated custodial staff enhanced their cleaning and disinfecting of university facilities. Their exceptional work has been a great service to us all.

Based on what we have learned from research reactivation over the summer, we are emphasizing to all our colleagues and students who are returning to campus in the fall that each of us has a vital role to play in maintaining the health and safety of our community. Every single one of our choices, from putting on a face covering to maintaining distance from others, makes a difference.

Rigorous testing requirements for students, faculty, and staff for the fall semester

Yale has comprehensive testing policies to screen for COVID-19 infection and provide timely results and advice for the students, faculty, and staff who will be studying and working on campus in the fall. In addition, the university has established a contact tracing program and appropriate procedures for quarantine and isolation. The university’s testing, quarantine, isolation, and contact tracing plans for all groups are available at the health and safety guidelines webpage. Yale’s rigorous testing and other policies will help us identify asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and contain the spread of the virus in our community. By adhering to the university’s policies, we can make our contribution to maintaining the encouraging public health situation in Connecticut.

Avoiding travel once we are together in New Haven

Once we are together in New Haven, we must avoid travel as much as possible. Many communities across the nation are struggling to contain outbreaks of COVID-19. In order to protect our Yale and New Haven communities, we must minimize the risk of imported infections by limiting travel outside of Connecticut. For example, we reorganized the academic calendar to minimize out-of-state travel during the semester. Undergraduates may travel only for emergencies or with approval from their residential college deans’ offices for travel that is essential for educational or personal reasons. Yale strongly urges graduate and professional students, faculty, and staff to limit their travel as well.

Everyone should wear face coverings, maintain social distancing, and practice other health protective behaviors while traveling. Travelers returning from abroad or any state with a high prevalence of COVID-19 must be tested for COVID-19 and self-quarantine in their rooms or apartments for 14 days. Other domestic travelers are encouraged to be tested through the Yale COVID-19 Screening Program upon return.

A significantly de-densified campus in the fall

When we announced plans for the fall semester on July 1, we wrote about the importance of de-densifying the residential colleges and other university housing for preventing community spread of COVID-19. The residential colleges will be at less than 40 percent capacity when students return. This fact reduces the risk of a surge in COVID-19 infection on campus and in our home city, but only if those living off campus are just as vigilant as those on campus in adhering to social distancing, wearing face coverings, avoiding large gatherings, and self-monitoring for COVID-19 symptoms. Although I wish this pandemic were behind us by now and that we could invite all students back, we must remain focused on the health and safety of those on our campus and in our region, as we return to teaching and learning.
 
###

As a research university, we have a responsibility to contribute knowledge and understanding, particularly during times of turbulence. We must also demonstrate to others the importance of taking actions for the common good based on scientific evidence. Together, we handled the abrupt, unexpected disruption to our work and lives last spring by embracing expert advice. Together, we will continue to be vigilant in the coming year to safeguard public health while maintaining the continuity of Yale’s commitment to education, research, and scholarship.

My colleagues and I will keep you apprised of any significant change in the spread of COVID-19 or Yale’s plans for the fall. In the meantime, please remember that every health protective decision we make helps to safeguard our own well-being and the health of others in our community. It will take our collective actions and commitment to prevent the spread of this disease to those with whom we come in contact and to end this pandemic.

With best wishes for your health and safety,

Dear Members of the Yale Community,

I am pleased to share this newly expanded weekly email designed to provide you with timely information about the actions we are taking together to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 on campus and promote the health of our Yale and New Haven communities.

Over the past month, our graduate and professional students have been settling into new routines on and off campus. Increasing numbers of staff and faculty are returning to their offices and labs, and are following new health and safety measures. And we are now poised to welcome new and returning undergraduates next week for the beginning of a remarkable academic year. YaleNews has posted a story detailing many aspects of our preparations for the fall.  

Let’s work together to take the steps we know will make a difference:

COVID-19 Viral Testing
Our screening protocol uses viral testing to identify asymptomatic cases of infection, provide treatment and advice to those who are infected, and curb the further spread of the virus on campus. Learn more about Yale’s approach to (and requirements around) testing.

Further Evidenced-based Practices
From the outset of the pandemic, the University has adopted measures mandated by the State of Connecticut and recommended by our own public health experts. These Health and Safety Guidelines will be effective only if each of us does our part to follow them.

For the duration of the pandemic, we will share vital statistics about the spread of COVID in our community. As the data highlighted below show, we are presently seeing a low rate of infection. Let’s do all we can to maintain this condition.

You can expect related, targeted communications from various leaders at Yale over the course of the fall semester. And for the duration, covid19.yale.edu will serve as the hub for all University-wide guidance. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have questions about our programs or ideas about how we can do even more to protect our community.

A Message From the President, Provost, and Deans
 	 
	
Dear Yale Students,

We’ve given you a lot to read regarding COVID-19, so we will get right to the point with this message, which may be the most important one we send.

Please don't party on campus or in town this fall. For the good of the Yale community. For the good of our beloved home city.

Or, more formally:

No student in the New Haven area, whether enrolled, withdrawn, or on a leave of absence, may host, invite others to, or attend a party with more than 10 people, whether on or off campus. Yale is prepared to enforce this policy with disciplinary action if necessary.

In addition, as a reminder, at any gatherings, everyone must wear face-coverings and maintain 6-foot distancing; in some spaces, even 10 people will be too many.

Please talk with friends and classmates about how to socialize responsibly. If you learn of an event that raises concerns, tell a responsible person in your school or residential college.

We’ve seen universities across the country have to reverse course for a simple, preventable reason: students partied, and people got sick. By not having parties (and by wearing our masks and social distancing), we are doing our part to keep others healthy. It’s a great way to show respect to those who make Yale, Yale—both across campus and across town.

This message and protocol apply to every Yale student—undergraduate, graduate, or professional—who will be living in or visiting New Haven. Some of you have enrolled in the Fall term, some of you are withdrawn, and some of you are taking a leave of absence. Regardless of their current status, all members of our community have responsibilities to one another.

We know from talking to many of you that you share our concern, commitment—and optimism. We’re grateful that Yale College Council President Kahlil Greene and Graduate Student Assembly Chair Meaghan McGeary were kind enough to record a very brief video with their thoughts on this issue.

Thanks very much for reading this—and, we hope, for listening to Meaghan and Kahlil. We are extremely excited to be able to have an on-campus experience this year. Let’s do ourselves proud.

We wish you all a great start to the year!

Sincerely,

To all students enrolled in residence who are living off campus,

This week, many of you are returning to New Haven, joining others who have been here all summer.  Before the semester starts, I want you to understand the expectations that you will need to meet in order to protect the health of everyone in the Yale and New Haven communities, as well as your own. I wrote last week to students living on campus with a similar message. Making an in-residence semester possible will be a communal effort, and everyone has to know their roles and responsibilities, starting on day one.

After reading my August 17 message to you, you should by now have taken your pre-arrival test; understood the distinction between initial testing, which ends August 29, and term-time testing, which begins on August 31; set up a MyChart account; and scheduled your initial testing. Many of you, in fact, have already taken your initial on-campus test; depending on the date of your initial test you, should have scheduled a second or even a third test this week. Later this week, you will receive information about twice-weekly term-time testing and how to schedule those appointments.

You should also by now understand how you will be expected to quarantine: within your off-campus residence for the 24 to 36 hours it takes to receive the result of your initial on-campus test, regardless of where you are traveling from or if you have already been in the New Haven area.

If you have just arrived from a restricted state, you will need to complete this form and continue to quarantine in your off-campus residence for 14 days. This is true even if you test negative. The State of Connecticut's FAQ page has more information about quarantine requirements that you will need to follow as members of the general public. If you are from a non-restricted state, or are arriving from outside the country and have satisfied the CDC’s guidelines, you do not need to quarantine after you receive a negative test result from your initial on-campus test.

The State of Connecticut has additional requirements for students living on campus, who will not be allowed to leave their residential college, the Old Campus, or their other campus housing for 14 days after they arrive, regardless of the origin of their travel. They may not interact with off-campus students until their quarantine period ends.

As an off-campus student during this quarantine, you will only have access to campus for your own testing appointments; when you come in for your tests, you must avoid contact with on-campus students. Your access to campus will begin on September 12.

*  *  *

After the arrival quarantine ends for everyone, on- and off-campus students will have more freedom to move around and interact as a residential community. Still, the arrival quarantine is just the beginning. All semester, you will need to continue to follow the basic but essential practices of washing your hands often and wearing a face covering. You will need to observe social distance guidelines, staying six feet apart and avoiding any but the smallest gatherings. You will need to be scrupulous in attending to your regular viral tests; if you or a close contact tests positive, you will need to isolate or quarantine again, with even stricter limitations. Large gatherings such as parties will still be prohibited. You will be expected to stay alert to public health guidelines and instructions throughout the semester, and follow them. You will be expected to understand and respond to a lot of information that the university will provide to you regularly.

You will not do any of this alone, and you will have plenty of support. Keep in mind that the college heads and deans, the directors of the cultural centers, advisers, coaches, chaplains, and of course your instructors are all here for you. You will be hearing from many of them, and from me, throughout the semester, and we will all be working to guide you along the way. 

I am welcoming you this year with these sober expectations not to discourage you. On the contrary, I emphasize them to remind you why you have chosen and worked so hard to come here: to belong to this community and contribute to it. In any other year, you might do that in a million different ways, letting your curiosity and natural gifts guide you. This year, you will all do that by taking responsibility for your behavior and holding yourself accountable, keeping yourself safe and healthy, and recognizing how much the health and safety of others depend on the actions you take every day.

None of this takes away from the excitement that awaits you in the term that is about to start -- faculty who are eager to start classes with you, friends and colleagues waiting to see you again, and a campus rich with resources that are here for you. Your curiosity and natural gifts will still guide you, leading you in different directions, even as you know that everyone around you is moving in the same one, through their choices and behavior. We are all in this together.

To the Yale College community,

I am writing to report that viral screening required of all students enrolled in residence has returned the first positive result of a Yale College student on campus. The student is asymptomatic, is resting comfortably, and is in isolation housing that has been designated for students as they test positive for the virus throughout the semester. Contact tracers have notified the relevant authorities and everyone who has been in close contact with the student. Protocols in place for bringing students back to campus are working as they should.

Nevertheless, this is a moment to stress the importance for everyone in the community to comply with testing and quarantine requirements; follow the practices of physical distancing, frequent hand washing, and wearing face coverings; and abide by the terms of the community compact, which all students enrolled in residence must sign as a condition for returning to campus. Although I will not be writing to announce future positive results, the university's statistics about COVID-19 are publicly available here, and its health and safety guidelines are available here.

This Friday, August 28, at 5:00 p.m. EDT, I will be hosting an online discussion of the opening of Yale College, including preparations for COVID-19, along with campus officials. I invite you to join us. A link to the discussion, which is open to all Yale College students and their families, will be available on Yale College's FAQ page. It will also be recorded. If you have a question, you can submit it beforehand by clicking here.

I thank the faculty and staff for their efforts to prepare the campus to open as smoothly as it has and to welcome students back with such a successful move-in week. I look forward to starting the semester with you all.

Sincerely,

Dear students enrolled in residence,

Now that so many of you are arriving and getting settled in, this is a good time to make sure you understand the current public health expectations and know who is here to help you meet them.

Public Health Coordinators
Start by learning about the Public Health Coordinators, who are graduate and professional school students living in the colleges to help everyone in the community work together to protect the public health.

If you have questions about what’s expected of you, you can get in touch with the PHCs.  They may also write to you, if you need some coaching in keeping the commitments you made in the compact. The PHCs will also be on call as liaisons for emergency response within the colleges.

You can read more about the PHC program and learn about your college's PHC here.  Feel free to email your college’s PHC with questions or ideas. If you have an urgent concern, you can call 203-737-1414 to reach the PHCs at any time.

A team of undergraduates will soon be joining the PHCs to support the community in making positive choices for the public health. I will be writing to you about them in a future message.

Community Accountability
We are all going to have to hold ourselves and each other accountable this semester in order to protect the public health. Our choices and behavior have consequences that affect the  community. If you need guidance, it will be easy to find, and safeguards are in place, too.

If you have concerns about situations or behaviors that may be putting the community at risk, you have options for how to respond. You can of course talk with the people involved; if you do, you will have the most impact if you focus on support, goals, and problem-solving. You can also turn to your PHC or Head of College. If you prefer to share your concerns in writing, you can use this form to communicate with the Office of Student Affairs.

Accountability goes both ways, so you may also get feedback on your own behavior. Any you receive is an opportunity to hear concerns, respond to new information, and learn. In most cases, feedback might come from a simple conversation with your PHC or Head of College. If it looks like your actions are putting the community at risk, you might also hear from the Compact Review Committee, which focuses on education and guidance but, if necessary, can limit access to campus or even revoke it. In rare cases of behaviors that endanger the community Yale College’s formal disciplinary body, the Executive Committee, may need to get involved.

Expectations about travel
You might remember from my July 1 message to you that you are expected to stay within the state. If an emergency or urgent need arises, you will need to ask permission to travel. Next week, an online form will be available; in the meantime, you may write to student.affairs@yale.edu.

These opening weeks are a time to pay special attention to information that will help you meet your public health expectations. You will have a lot of help, so ask for it if you need it. And we will need to help each other, too. This is a semester when we are all going to be working together.

With best wishes,

Marvin M. Chun

A Message from our COVID-19 Coordinator
 	 
	
Dear Members of the Yale Community,

As move-in week for undergraduates concludes, we are seeing a small number of positive COVID-19 cases, which was not unanticipated. The By the Numbers information below shares a high-level overview of Yale data on testing and positive cases.

We need to rely on our continued vigilance and the collective actions of our community if we are to keep these numbers low.

While we are continually learning more about COVID-19, it is clear that the most common way for the virus to spread is through person-to-person interactions. One way to reduce the risk of spread is to follow our health and safety guidelines, such as mask wearing and social distancing. Another important strategy for reducing transmission of the virus is to identify those with infections and instruct them to isolate while they are infectious.  It is also important to identify close contacts of infected individuals and instruct them to quarantine during the time when they might develop the disease as a result of their close exposure.  The goal is to keep those in isolation and quarantine healthy, but separated, to prevent the spread of the virus to others.

When should I quarantine?

Quarantining prevents you from unknowingly infecting others, if you have been exposed to the virus and are at risk for developing an infection as a result of that exposure.

Arrival Quarantine: If you are arriving to campus or returning from travel from a state with a high positive test rate, you are required to remain in your residence for 14 days, following the instructions issued by the State of Connecticut. Undergraduates living on campus have additional restrictions as described in the Yale College FAQs:

Contact Quarantine: If you have been in close contact--within 6 feet of distance for more than 15 minutes--with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 you will need to quarantine in your residence for 14 days.  You may be notified of the need to quarantine through Yale’s contact tracing program.

When should I isolate?

If you have tested positive for COVID-19 or been told by your health care provider that you have COVID-19, you must separate yourself from others who are not infected—even if you have no symptoms. You should get medical advice, especially if you have COVID-19 symptoms, by calling your primary care provider or one of the key resources listed below for assistance.  Yale Health will also provide clinical advice during your self-isolation and let you know when you may resume your normal activities. Additionally, you will be referred for contact tracing to identify others who may be at risk for infection.

I encourage you to review the health and safety guidelines webpage for more information regarding these topics. In addition, please reach out to any of the key resources listed below whenever a question arises.

A Message from our COVID-19 Coordinator
 	 
	
Dear Members of the Yale Community,

Contact tracing involves notifying people who have recently been in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 about their  exposure and ensuring that they can take care of themselves and limit further spread of the virus. This is a critical public health activity that is essential to keeping our campus and surrounding community as safe as possible during this pandemic. 

All members of Yale’s Contact Tracing Team (YCTT) are highly trained in an evidence-based protocol that is informed by CDC guidance. Cooperation with the YCTT is essential to promoting a safe environment for all of us.

What happens if I test positive for COVID-19?

Yale Health clinicians will ask you to isolate—even if you are asymptomatic—and continue to monitor your health. A member of Yale’s YCTT will call you to discuss your close contacts (people with whom you were within 6 feet for 15 minutes or more) and recent activities. Your identity and medical information will be kept confidential. Because a complete and candid conversation is critical to the success of the contact tracing program, information you give to the YCTT about close contacts will not be used for other purposes, including discipline. After speaking to you, the YCCT will notify close contacts of their potential exposure and provide support and guidance.

What happens if I’m notified that I am a close contact?

If you have been notified by the YCCT that you were in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, the YCCT representative will ask you to quarantine and perform a daily health check for 14 days after the date of the exposure. Because close contacts may develop a COVID-19 infection, adhering to the quarantine is essential to preventing ongoing virus transmission. While quarantining, limit your interactions with others, maintain the proper social distance, and wear a mask whenever in the presence of others. Connecting with friends and family will be important for your wellbeing during this time and you are encouraged to do so virtually. If any symptoms of COVID-19 appear, please get in touch with your primary health care provider right away or call the Campus COVID Resource Line at 203-432-6604.

Guidance for what to do during quarantine:

- Fact Sheet for Students On Campus
- Fact Sheet for Students Off Campus
- Fact Sheet for Faculty & Staff
 

Complete your Daily Health Check	Keep track of everyone with whom you’ve been in contact	Help slow the spread of COVID-19
Remember, symptoms can appear 2-14 days after exposure.
If you test positive for COVID-19, this information will be helpful to share with Yale’s contact tracing team.
Note where your activity with others took place.
Yale’s CTT will only contact people with whom you have been in close contact (within 6 feet for more than 15 minutes).
Your identity will not be shared.
Thank you for following all our preventive measures and taking swift action whenever questions of health and safety arise. The wellbeing of each of us depends on the actions and commitment of all of us.

Dear students,

Most of you are just past the midpoint of your arrival quarantine, and many of you have raised some good questions about it. Here are some answers:

Why do my arrival quarantine and testing go on for so long?
It is possible to develop COVID-19 well after being exposed, so you might still be in the incubation stage even though you have tested negative. The guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is to quarantine for 14 days, long enough to catch most infections that may have been incubating on arrival. By continuing to test during quarantine, you can receive immediate care if you receive a positive result.

If you are living off campus and arrived from a restricted state, you need to follow a 14-day arrival quarantine, in accordance with Connecticut guidelines.

If you are living on campus and arrived during the initial move-in period, you need to adhere to the 14-day arrival quarantine regardless of your travel origin. The terms of the arrival quarantine period are necessary for Yale to fulfill its reopening obligations to the city of New Haven and the State of Connecticut.

What is contact quarantine, and how is it different from arrival quarantine?
If a contact tracer calls you and tells you to begin contact quarantine, it is because you have been in close contact with a person who has tested positive. (Close contact means within six feet for more than 15 minutes, with or without a mask or face covering.) If you are living on campus, be sure to follow the contact quarantine instructions that you can find here. If you are living off campus, be sure to follow the contact quarantine instructions that you can find here.

When is the arrival quarantine period over?
Individual arrival quarantines end on a rolling basis, with the earliest arrivals ending before the later ones.

To determine when your arrival quarantine ends, add 14 days to the day you arrived. If, say, you moved in on August 24, your arrival quarantine ends on September 7. If you live on campus, you will also be receiving a message in the next 48 hours to confirm the day your arrival quarantine ends.

Beginning Friday, September 11, many parts of campus will be more widely available: as long as your own quarantine has ended, you will have access to dining hall seating, the gym, and the library. If you are enrolled in classes with an in-person option, you will be able to attend those beginning the week of September 14.

Thanks to your efforts, the number of students in contact quarantine is still low. Keep up the good work: make sure your face covering is secure and keep practicing that six foot distance in groups of any size, and none larger than 10. Finally, be sure you are sticking to your testing schedule. All these steps are crucial. I am grateful to you all for working together.

Sincerely,

Dear students,

With the arrival quarantine period nearly over, this first, critical phase of the semester is ending. Thank you for your cooperation and patience in following the quarantine guidelines. Keep in mind, though, that the hard work of keeping our low COVID-19 numbers is just beginning. You will now be moving more freely around campus, New Haven, and Connecticut, and interacting with other students and the general public. After spending two weeks under quarantine restrictions, you might be tempted to relax some of the good habits you have started to form and that have kept those numbers so low. Please instead keep up the excellent work you are already doing: cover your face when you are in public, stay six feet apart, keep your hands clean, stick to your testing schedule, and avoid gatherings with over ten people.

The actions you take in the weeks ahead are going to make all the difference in what the semester looks like. Start by reminding yourself of the terms of the community compact that you agreed to uphold as a condition for returning to campus -- really reading it so that you understand it in both letter and spirit, and taking to heart your obligation to keep yourself informed of evolving public health guidelines. Be conscientious in your daily habits, not letting down your guard -- or your mask. Don't be afraid to speak up if you see others who are not doing their part. While mutual support and shared expectations will get us a long way, educational and even disciplinary mechanisms are also available when necessary in order to protect everyone's health. And if someone approaches you about your own actions, listen to them: use that feedback to avoid putting others at risk.

Spaces outside your residential colleges will be opening in the next few days. This is an exciting time to explore, have fun, and engage with each other and the community -- while practicing those new good habits of yours. If you are new here, this is a great time to ask a first-year counselor, Peer Liaison, or PHC for suggestions. If you are returning to campus and are thinking about weekend options that don’t involve gatherings, this is a great time to rediscover campus and New Haven. To get you started, a goodie bag of coupons, available here, will get you free or discounted coffee, cupcakes, and cookies around town. And as you look ahead and plan your own activities for the semester, you will be able to use the libraries, classrooms in WLH (William L. Harkness Hall), Watson, Linsly-Chittenden, which you can reserve, and the Yale Science Building pavilion and Marsh Hall area. Other buildings with offices, laboratories, and department common areas are restricted for in-person classes and research only. The gym will open on Monday.

Finally, as you start this new phase of the semester, mindful of your actions and the community's health, know where you can find information: the university's COVID-19 site is the best place to start, and so is Yale College's FAQ page, where you can find links to the community compact, the PHCs, the Compact Review Committee, and the Community Concerns form for sharing information about situations or behaviors that you feel may be putting the community’s health and safety at risk. These resources are here for you. So are the heads, deans, FroCos, Peer Liaisons, and PHCs. I thank them for all the work they have done to support you, and I thank you for working with them in the weeks and months ahead. The goal of protecting everyone's health involves us all.

Sincerely,

A Message from our COVID-19 Coordinator
 	 
	
Dear Members of the Yale Community,

As our campus population grows with the return of students, faculty, and staff, testing for COVID-19 is a vital component of Yale’s strategy to prevent the spread of the virus  and to promote a healthy Yale for all who teach, learn, and work at the University. Our protocols have been developed to focus our testing on those circumstances where an infection may be most likely to lead to a larger outbreak. The By the Numbers information below shares our daily test results through September 9, 2020.

While the numbers have been low thus far, we must maintain our vigilance and our collective commitment to taking the actions necessary to protect our community—being mindful that testing supplements but does not replace the need for each of us to follow all of Yale’s health and safety measures.

Advantages of COVID-19 testing

Frequent testing for COVID-19 allows the University to identify asymptomatic cases of infection, provide treatment and advice to those who test positive, and curb the further spread of the virus on campus and in the New Haven community. By notifying and isolating asymptomatic individuals who test positive, we can prevent them from unknowingly transmitting the virus to others. Since August 1, almost 25,000 tests have been performed on Yale students, faculty, and staff. To learn more about the testing program and how it works, visit the Yale COVID-19 Screening Program website.

Testing is one part of our overall strategy to reduce the likelihood of asymptomatic spread of infection in our community. As we have seen in other university settings, testing will not prevent outbreaks if other healthy community behaviors are not in place. Wearing a mask, social distancing, consistent hand hygiene, and following University guidance related to gatherings are equally critical in our prevention strategy.

Required COVID-19 testing for students

The University requires all undergraduates and graduate and professional students who live in certain dormitory style housing to be tested twice weekly. Graduate and professional students who do not reside in dormitory style housing may voluntarily undergo testing up to one time per week. All students assume a shared responsibility to keep Yale healthy by completing their daily health check and participating in COVID-19 testing.

Required and voluntary COVID-19 testing for faculty and staff

Certain staff have been identified as having a higher likelihood of exposure to the virus in their day-to-day activities. These staff are required to have testing once per week.

Yale provides free voluntary asymptomatic COVID-19 testing up to one time per week for all faculty, staff, and postdoctoral trainees who will be on campus during the fall semester. Please consult these guidelines for current updates to this policy.

Symptomatic COVID-19 testing for students, faculty and staff

Yale Health provides testing and care for symptomatic individuals. Remember, if you do become ill with COVID-19 symptoms, stay home, contact your healthcare provider or the Campus COVID Resource Line immediately and follow their guidance.

By working together, we can honor our collective responsibility to each other, build a more connected community, and make an important contribution to a more healthy Yale.

Dear Members of the Yale Community,

I write to share news that Janet Lindner, vice president for human resources and administration, has decided to retire at the end of this calendar year. After serving our university with distinction for over two decades, she will be greatly missed.

Janet’s exemplary service to our community began in 1997. She came to Yale after working for the City of New Haven, where she served as the chief administrative officer. Since then, her responsibilities to our university have grown extensively. She has contributed to many milestones in the university’s history, such as Yale’s tercentennial celebrations, and has helped our campus overcome numerous emergencies, including the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Over the last two decades, she has made a tremendous impact on this university. She has served as a director of major projects, associate vice president for administration, and deputy vice president for human resources and administration. In 2017, I asked Janet to assume the role of the vice president for human resources and administration, in which she serves as a crucial strategic partner to university leaders, managers, and staff. In the past three years, she and her team have worked together with colleagues across campus to elevate the strategic role of the Office of Human Resources and Administration, developing a unified vision and plan for talent management and improving processes for hiring, career development, and retention.

Notably, Janet has been instrumental in increasing diversity among managers, more than doubling the proportion from historically underrepresented groups in the course of a decade. She has worked tirelessly to foster an inclusive and respectful culture at Yale. She often notes that how we approach our work every day can make a lasting difference and transform our community.

Early in her career, Janet was a union organizer and business agent in New York City. Her keen understanding of labor relations has benefited the Yale community. For example, she helped to usher in a more collaborative approach as a founding member of the union-management partnership that addresses problems in a culture of shared respect. Working closely with union leaders and community partners, she developed the university’s New Haven Hiring Initiative to create pipelines to careers at Yale.

Taking responsibility for public safety during a time of transition in 2010, Janet led a successful search for our police chief. Since, she has partnered with Yale police officers and staff within Yale Public Safety to serve our community. Most recently, she welcomed nationally recognized experts to assess all aspects of our policing, and the university is taking action based on that review.

Janet also has led the growth of many environmental initiatives at Yale. For example, she created Yale’s ridesharing initiative and the “Y-Bike” program, and she helped to transition Yale’s car and truck fleet toward using alternative fuel. I will long remember both her serious commitment to sustainability as well as her more lighthearted effort to include the beloved image of Handsome Dan on each shuttle.

Active in volunteer roles in our community, Janet has received numerous awards and recognition for public service and leadership. She is the executive sponsor of the Future Leaders of Yale affinity group and has mentored and coached many early, mid-, and late-career staff members throughout her time at Yale. She serves on the United Way of Greater New Haven’s board of directors, including as board chair from 2017 to 2019. She is a fellow of Saybrook College.

I am grateful to Janet for all that she has accomplished for Yale. Her knowledge of the university, appreciation for the people within our community, skill at consensus building, and ability to focus on the importance of our work—even in the most challenging of times—make her a remarkable colleague. I will soon launch a search, in collaboration with Senior Vice President for Operations Jack Callahan, for a new leader for human resources at Yale. In the meantime, please join me in thanking Janet, congratulating her on her accomplishments, and wishing her success in her next life chapter. Knowing Janet, her wisdom and indefatigable good spirit will continue to benefit all whose paths she crosses.

Dear students,

We are ending the third week of classes with few COVID-19 cases. Thanks to your efforts to stay six feet apart, cover your face, keep your hands clean, and stick to your testing schedules, only six students in Yale College have had positive results since the beginning of the move-in period, August 21. They have followed all protocols for isolation and contact tracing. Although the ideal number of positive results is zero, this low number is the result of your daily actions. Please keep up the good work.

Now that you are moving more freely around campus and New Haven, this is a good time to be thinking about new ways to interact with each other and the broader community. You know already that all classes have an online-only option, whether you live on campus or off, the only exception being international students who have an in-person visa requirement. You are also now able, thanks to the Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning, to enroll in non-credit Coursera courses to earn a certificate for free, here. But you might also want to explore online options for participating in other activities as well. A good place to start is the student organizations booths from the activities bazaar, extended until September 27. You can find them here.

For in-person events, you can plan ahead, whether you are a host or a guest: start by reading the safe party tips available here, then make sure you know about COVID-19 requirements for events and gatherings, available here and here, particularly capacity limitations, including within suites. Because this is going to be a semester of online and small gatherings, this is also a time to be thinking creatively about what social life will look like. For good ideas, talk with your college councils, first-year counselors, the peer liaisons, and of course your own friends and classmates. And keep in mind that you are under no obligation to attend any events in person.

The PHEPs -- Public Health Education for Peers -- can also help. They are fellow undergraduates who are working to promote harm-reductive behaviors and educate around public health guidelines, and they are able to provide creative and safe socializing options. The PHEPs represent every residential college, come from a variety of backgrounds, and are involved in campus activities including dance, music groups, athletics, and debate. They are excited and motivated to help, so keep them in mind as you plan your semester. You can read more about them here. And their “phep talks,” or office hours, start today. Here’s where you can find out more.

One final, simple step you can take to help: get a flu shot. Because COVID-19 and flu cause similar symptoms, reducing flu in the community preserves healthcare resources. On specific days in the coming two weeks, you will be able to get a flu shot at the site where you get your twice-weekly test. No appointment is needed. For the full schedule, and for more information, you can check Yale HEALTH's Flu Information for Yale Undergraduates, available here.

Thank you again for everything you are doing to protect the public’s health as well as your own. Your everyday actions are making a difference.

Dear Members of the Yale Community,

Yale offers many opportunities to make connections and establish friendships, which are often life-long. Now that more activities have resumed on campus and the student arrival quarantine has come to an end, people are eager to see one another and to explore Yale’s beautiful campus. As we enjoy the fall together, keep in mind that even with the current low incidence of COVID-19 on Yale’s campus, there is always the potential for viral transmission. As a community, we must continue to work together to limit the spread of COVID-19.

Step out and mask up

There is strong evidence that universal use of cloth face coverings or masks can reduce the spread of infection by containing respiratory droplets from an infected person when they cough, sneeze or talk. While wearing a cloth face covering or mask is a powerful tool in reducing the spread of COVID-19, to be most effective, it must be coupled with other preventive measures like physical distancing, frequent handwashing, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.

About face coverings

Following CDC recommendations, and Connecticut Governor Lamont’s statewide order, members of the Yale community are required to wear face coverings when in any shared space (e.g., common work areas, hallways, and restrooms) or outside area—even when maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from others. Please continue to follow the established practices below:

Mask up. In Connecticut, you can be fined $100 for not wearing a mask.
Always carry a mask, even when you don’t plan to be around others.
Be sure your mouth, nose, and chin are fully covered by the mask as advised by the CDC.
Wash cloth face coverings regularly.
Do not use masks with exhalation valves.
Do not use a face mask meant for a healthcare worker. N95 respirators must be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.
Follow EHS guidelines for the use of appropriate face coverings in research laboratories.
While we await vaccines and treatments that will effectively address the virus, it is important to comply with these simple yet proven measures. Remember, a face mask is meant to protect others—your friends, family, and colleagues—because any of us can carry the virus and spread the disease unknowingly, even if we have no symptoms.

With our collective commitment to ongoing vigilance, we can enjoy the special connections that a vibrant community like Yale offers and create a healthy Yale experience for all.

Dear students,

We are ending this fourth week of classes with still-low COVID-19 numbers: no new positive test results for 12 days in Yale College, no undergraduates in isolation, and none in quarantine. I am very grateful to you for being so attentive to keeping to your testing schedules, staying six feet apart from one another, covering your face in public, and adhering to the community compact in both letter and spirit. Thank you.

You were able to form your good habits during the arrival quarantine, when you restricted your movements to your residence. Now that you have been moving around campus and the community, this is a good time to remember to keep up those habits. They not only protect the public's health as well as your own; they also put others at ease by showing thoughtfulness and courtesy, which are very much appreciated when you are entering another residential college, a library, the gym, or any of the other places you visit off campus.

The good work you are doing now will become all the more important in the weeks ahead, as the weather cools and we spend more time indoors. Make sure you are being consistent in your actions, encouraging others if they are getting a little too close or forgetting to cover their face. It's okay to say something, and it's okay if someone says something to you. We are all relying on each other to stay healthy.

One final reminder: get a flu shot if you haven't already. Because COVID-19 and flu cause similar symptoms, reducing flu in the community preserves healthcare resources. On specific days, you will be able to get a flu shot at the site where you get your twice-weekly test. No appointment is needed. For the full schedule, and for more information, you can check Yale HEALTH's Flu Information for Yale Undergraduates, available here.

With best wishes for the weekend and the week ahead.

Sincerely,

Marvin M. Chun

A Message from our COVID-19 Coordinator
 	 
	
Dear Members of the Yale Community,

While travel has many benefits, during the pandemic it poses an increased risk of virus transmission and importation of COVID-19 into our campus and New Haven communities. The university has therefore restricted Yale-sponsored travel and strongly encouraged community members to limit travel for any reason. That said, there are times when travel is necessary.

Whether the travel is for an approved university purpose or for a personal need, such as a family emergency, everyone arriving at or returning to Yale’s campus must take steps to protect the health and safety of our community.

Travel Outside of Connecticut
Yale students have committed to remain in Connecticut until November 21, 2020. Enrolled undergraduate students must obtain approval to travel from the Yale College Health and Safety Leader (HSL) and must complete an authorization form and submit it to the HSL prior to approved travel. Enrolled graduate and professional students should consult with their HSLs about any travel plans and must complete a travel notification form and submit it to their HSLs prior to traveling. Faculty and staff should consult with their HSLs or supervisors before deciding to travel, and they must obtain approval from their supervisors in advance for Yale-sponsored travel; the Off Campus Research and Field Work Committee may approve travel for off-campus research or field work. Additionally, staff members must notify their supervisors of travel plans and dates of return.

Travel into Connecticut
Because travel increases the chances of travelers contracting COVID-19 and spreading it to others, the Governor of Connecticut has ordered that travelers to Connecticut from states with a high incidence of COVID-19 must quarantine for 14 days following arrival. The same holds true for travelers to Connecticut from a country with a Centers for Disease Control Level 3 Risk rating. With the exception of essential workers traveling for work purposes, this State requirement applies to all students, faculty, staff, and visitors.

Testing Out of Quarantine
To support and supplement Governor Lamont’s Executive Order 9C, effective September 23, Yale is requiring additional precautionary measures for members of our community who arrive at or return to Yale from an affected state or country. More specifically, Yale will allow “testing out” of the 14-day quarantine requirement after two tests are taken subsequent to arrival or return, and each test produces a negative result.  Accordingly, faculty, staff and students traveling from affected states or countries may:

Quarantine in their rooms or residences for 14 days after arrival; OR
Obtain a COVID-19 test through the COVID-19 Screening Program on the first day after arrival and a second test no earlier than four days later and quarantine until both tests results are received and are negative.
If individuals select the test-out option and either test is positive for COVID-19, those individuals will not be released from quarantine and must isolate in accordance with university protocols.

Please note:

The Yale two-test requirement applies to those individuals who are living, studying or working on campus. Staff and students who are working and studying remotely can follow Connecticut’s single-test alternative.
Healthcare workers, including health professional students, and Yale Health and Yale Medicine patient-facing employees, must also test twice, but will be allowed to return to clinical work after a first negative test while following all appropriate self-monitoring and PPE requirements for their healthcare roles.
Our collective efforts are keeping Yale’s incidence rates of COVID-19 low, and we must not only continue but rather redouble these efforts to prevent the spread of the virus on our campus. Thank you for all that you are doing to address this extraordinary challenge.

A Message from our COVID-19 Coordinator
 	 
	
Dear Members of the Yale Community,
 
Over the past weeks, the Yale community’s shared commitment to protecting the health and safety of our campus and our city has been clearly visible and extremely impressive. Students, faculty, and staff alike have risen to the occasion by creating safer spaces in which to learn, live, and study and by practicing behaviors that will reduce the risk of transmitting COVID-19 to others.

What does it mean to be Green?

You may have noticed that we recently changed the university’s alert level to Green and wondered why. We made the move from Yellow to Green because we have completed the period when many students and others were arriving to campus from numerous locations. We considered this “arrival period” a time of heightened uncertainty, especially with regard to the risk of imported viral infections and the effectiveness with which the campus community would adopt our health and safety guidelines. Because we have passed through the arrival period with a low rate of viral infection and because community members have adopted the Community Compact and Community Expectations not just in letter but in spirit, we have moved to Green.

So what does Green mean? It simply means we are out of the arrival period. It means keep up the good work and don’t let your guard down. For now, all of our health and safety measures and restrictions, such as those pertaining to the size of events and gatherings, remain in place. However, if we continue to see great results regarding viral transmission, we may relax some restrictions in the future. But don’t expect we’ll be “back to normal” soon. Nothing is normal during a pandemic, and you are all keeping us healthy through your diligence.

Did you check in today?

One way we can protect the health of the campus, and our family and friends, is to monitor our health daily for symptoms that may be associated with COVID-19. If you do have symptoms, take good care of yourself and call your primary care provider, Yale Employee Health at 203-432-7978, Student Health at 203-432-0312 or the Campus COVID Resource Line at 203-432-6604. Additionally, it is extremely important that you stay at home and avoid interactions with others until you are cleared by a health care provider to return to normal activities.

Complete your Daily Health Check

The University requires the completion of health checks for enrolled students in residence and for faculty and staff who plan to come to campus. You can fulfill your University requirement easily by submitting a Daily Health Check through the:

LiveSafe App; the LiveSafe web page has instructions for downloading the app if you have not done so already; or
Online Daily Health Check; or
Printable Health Check that you provide to your supervisor.
Compliance with safety measures, such as the daily health check, is extremely important in safeguarding the health of the Yale community. Those who fail to abide by these measures may have their campus access restricted.

If you have concerns or questions related to this or other requirements, you may contact your Health and Safety Leader or the Campus COVID Resource Line.

I want to express my admiration and appreciation for the many members of the campus community who helped us get to Green. Let’s all keep working together to keep our campus healthy.

Dear students,

We are at the end of the fifth week of the semester, a good moment to pause and think about how things are going for you, not only with your physical health but also with your classes, your other commitments, and your overall well-being. We are living in a time that brings new challenges every day --  to social justice, financial stability, and public health -- increasing the effort it takes to manage even routine obligations. Remember that there are many people here to help you: residential college heads and deans, cultural center directors and assistant directors, peer liaisons, first-year counselors, coaches, chaplains, and your instructors. You can talk to any of them. You can also find other campus resources to help you here and here.

Many of you are looking for opportunities to spend time with each other, in person, to balance the time you are spending on your own. If you need places to study together or if you are planning meetings, remember that spaces in certain classroom buildings are available to you as long as you follow all proper safety guidelines. Although the classrooms are not for parties, they are an option for lower-key socializing. You can find the list of designated classroom buildings here, and you can reserve rooms in them here; the buildings that are not on the list are restricted for in-person classes and research only.

You are also welcome to host or attend small social gatherings in your suites or off-campus housing -- again following all public safety guidelines: no more than one guest per resident, no more than ten people total, with face coverings and physical distancing. You can find guidelines for planning parties here, and you can always schedule a conversation about hosting skills with the Alcohol and Other Drugs Harm Reduction Initiative here.

And please use and enjoy the outdoors as much as possible, particularly while the weather is still warm. Be neighborly, of course, and choose your locations well to preserve the quiet in the residential colleges for the students who live in them. Cross Campus, Old Campus, and the Stiles-Morse Crescent are great spots if you need more room.

Keep up the good work -- avoid gatherings of more than ten people, stay six feet apart from one another, clean your hands often, and keep your face covered -- and have a great weekend and week ahead.

Dear students,

I am writing to share an update on international opportunities sponsored by Yale College. I understand that many of you are eager to know what Yale plans for the spring term on campus in order to make your plans for next semester. Information about spring in New Haven will be announced by early November.

In accordance with the Yale University International Travel Policy for Yale College Students, College-sponsored outbound international travel from the United States, such as study abroad and international fellowships, will continue to be suspended for Yale College students for the duration of the academic year, including the fall term, the winter recess, and the spring term. A decision about summer international travel and sponsored activities will be announced before the start of the spring 2021 term.

As travel restrictions have limited the opportunity to study abroad for members of the junior class, I have approved a special exception to allow students who will have a status of first-semester senior during fall 2021 or spring 2022 to study abroad for one semester as long as it is not the final semester of enrollment. Study abroad is not guaranteed for these terms, and all other eligibility requirements continue to apply.

With best wishes,

Dear students,

With tonight’s calendar announcement, the president and provost have provided the outlines for Spring 2021. As the details become available over the coming weeks, I will be writing to share them with you and with your parents and guardians. Updates about the spring, and also about the winter break, will be posted on Yale College's FAQ page.

For those of you enrolled in residence now, some of the initial details will address the steps for departing at the end of November. If you are a first-year, you will be able to store your belongings until you return to campus. A limited number of first-years in certain circumstances will be able to request permission to remain on campus; that application will be available soon.

If you are a sophomore, junior, or senior, you will soon receive a survey asking you to declare your enrollment and housing plans. To be enrolled in residence—that is, to have access to campus—sophomores must live in the residential colleges. Juniors and seniors have the additional option to enroll in residence and live off campus. Once housing demand is known, I will be able to provide more details. Information about viral testing and arrival quarantine will also be available once those protocols have been finalized.

While tonight’s email prompts us to look ahead, we are of course still only halfway through this semester. Sophomores: I am especially thankful to you for your patience and flexibility during this semester as you have studied remotely. I am looking forward to welcoming you to campus in the spring. And to all students, I am grateful to you all for finding ways to make this unusual semester work so well.

Dear Members of the Yale Community,

We write to share with you spring 2021 plans, which are shaped by your extraordinary work this semester to meet the challenges of teaching, learning, and conducting research amid a pandemic. We have been able to contain the spread of COVID-19 on our campus to date while preparing the next generation of thinkers and leaders, nurturing ideas that improve the world, and pursuing knowledge that can change lives.

Thank you for adhering to the university’s health protective policies and fulfilling our responsibilities to one another and our neighbors. Since August 1, Yale has tested nearly 9,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students for COVID-19 multiple times, and twenty-one students have tested positive. Those who tested positive have isolated themselves and participated in Yale’s contact tracing program so close contacts can quarantine. Of course, we are only halfway through the fall semester, but we know our community will continue to safeguard public health while advancing Yale’s mission.

SPRING 2021 ACADEMIC CALENDAR

Today we announce the spring semester calendar for Yale College based upon the recommendations of the University Calendar Committee. Graduate and professional school students will receive their academic calendars from the deans of their schools in the coming days.

This calendar allows us to build on what we have been able to achieve so far in the fall term. Although COVID-19 is well controlled locally, cases are surging in many other parts of the country. To help maintain the health of our home city and state, we must minimize travel outside of Connecticut.

For the spring semester, we will adjust the academic calendar by delaying the start date and eliminating spring break. Most schools, including Yale College, will begin classes on February 1 and end instruction on May 7. Five break days will be distributed throughout the semester to decompress the pace of the spring. Unless undergraduates receive permission to travel, they must remain in Connecticut during their days off.

Yale College Spring 2021 Calendar

 Feb 1	 Term starts; classes begin
 Feb 22	 First break day
 March 9	 Second break day
 March 19	 Last day of first half-term courses
 March 22	 First day of second half-term courses
 March 24	 Third break day
 March 26	 Midterm
 April 8	 Fourth break day
 April 23	 Fifth break day
 May 7	 Classes end
 May 8-12	 Reading period
 May 13-19	 Final exam period
 May 19	 Term ends
 May 20-24	 Senior week
 May 24	 University Commencement
 
Undergraduate students will be able to move into on-campus residences on designated days in late January. Students will be required to take a pre-arrival test and follow testing and quarantine protocols upon arrival as set by the State of Connecticut and the university. Students will then maintain a regular testing schedule throughout the semester. All undergraduate courses will be taught fully online during the arrival quarantine period. The Yale College Dean’s Office will send students details about undergraduate move-in, testing, and quarantine in the coming weeks.

MAINTAINING A DE-DENSIFIED CAMPUS AND CONTINUING OUR COMPREHENSIVE PROTOCOLS

We will invite sophomores, juniors, and seniors to live on campus or in the New Haven area during the spring semester. We encourage first-year undergraduates to continue their studies with Yale’s faculty remotely. Sophomores and first-year students who enroll for both the fall and spring semesters, with at least one term taken remotely, will be eligible to take two courses in Yale Summer Session. Yale will cover the cost of tuition for these two summer courses.

In the spring semester, as in the fall, all Yale College courses will be available remotely, taught with some combination of synchronous and asynchronous components. A few courses will also offer in-person instruction with physical distancing and other precautions.

Even with strong adherence to physical distancing and mask-wearing this semester, students are nonetheless sharing knowledge, connecting with one another, and conducting research. They also are finding new ways to perform public service in New Haven and in other communities. The spring, like the fall, will present unique and unexpected obstacles, but we know from experience that Yale students are up to the challenge.

GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL COURSES AND RESIDENTIAL LIVING

Graduate and professional school students were among the first to return to campus after we limited university operations last spring. By all measures, they have done an excellent job of carrying out their studies, conducting research and engaging in scholarship, wearing masks, physically distancing, and avoiding large gatherings of people.

In the spring, graduate and professional school students will continue to have the option of staying in on-campus housing. The same COVID-19 preventative measures in effect in the fall semester will be in effect in the spring. The dean of each school will provide students detailed information about coursework in the coming weeks, but most courses will be taught remotely or with a mix of online and in-person options.

TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND OTHER OPERATIONS FOR FACULTY AND STAFF

Whether working on campus or remotely at home, our faculty and staff have ensured that we can continue to educate students and create knowledge, coordinate with city and state officials to share best practices and strategic planning, and carry out clinical operations to save lives. We remain committed to supporting everyone at Yale who has been working tirelessly to sustain Yale’s mission.

We anticipate that staff required on campus at the start of the spring semester largely will be consistent with current staffing requirements for the fall semester. As we approach the spring semester, managers will inform any additional staff about whether they are needed on campus. Until then, anyone who can work from home should continue to do so. Provost Scott Strobel and Jack Callahan Jr., senior vice president for operations, will provide more information in the coming weeks.

CONTINUED COVID-19 PREVENTION

We know from our experiences since March that it is difficult to predict the spread of COVID-19. Based on how well members of our community have responded to the pandemic so far, we will extend all health protective policies into the spring semester. These include previously announced rules concerning travel, visitors, events and gatherings, dining, testing, and contact tracing, as well as other policies and health guidelines. We remind you that no student in the New Haven area—whether enrolled, withdrawn, or on a leave of absence—may host, invite others to, or attend a party with more than ten people, on or off campus.

We are monitoring COVID-19 prevalence, the development of vaccines and treatments, the implementation of rapid testing, and other factors that could affect our plans for the spring. We will keep you apprised of any changes.

***


We are deeply grateful to all those who have gone above and beyond during this turbulent period to ensure that we can emerge from this crisis with strength and resilience. We not only built a system that can contain the spread of COVID-19 while allowing us to realize our mission and aspirations, but we also have demonstrated our care for one another by consistently practicing physical distancing, mask-wearing, hand washing, and other health protective behaviors. We look forward to working with you to finish the fall semester as strongly as we started and continue our efforts in the spring.

Dear Members of the Yale Community,

In August, I wrote to let you know about the Department of Justice’s (DOJ’s) allegation that Yale’s undergraduate admissions practices discriminate against Asian American and white applicants. Over the last few weeks, Yale has provided DOJ with information showing that this allegation is based on inaccurate statistics and unfounded conclusions, such as DOJ’s claim that the proportion of various racial groups admitted to Yale has remained stable for many years. In fact, in the last two decades, the percentage of admitted applicants fluctuated significantly for all groups. Despite our efforts to correct these misconceptions and the fact that Yale’s undergraduate admissions practices are perfectly consistent with decades of Supreme Court precedent, tonight DOJ filed a lawsuit against our university.

I want to be clear: Yale does not discriminate against applicants of any race or ethnicity. Our admissions practices are completely fair and lawful. Yale’s admissions policies will not change as a result of the filing of this baseless lawsuit. We look forward to defending these policies in court.

In thinking about this issue, it is important to bear in mind the quality of Yale’s admissions pool. Even if we thought that relying on GPA and test scores alone was in Yale’s best interest, we could not take that course because we have too many applicants with excellent academic qualifications. More important, Yale would not be well served by looking only at GPA and test scores, which do not provide a complete picture of each applicant.

Our admissions process considers as many aspects as possible of an applicant’s life experiences and accomplishments. That does include race and ethnicity, but only as one element in a multi-stage examination of the entire application file, which takes into account test scores, grades, teacher recommendations, extracurricular activities, military service, and many other factors. No single element is considered independently of the whole application. We take this approach because we know that exposure to a diverse student body improves students’ critical thinking, problem-solving, and leadership skills and prepares them to thrive in a complex, dynamic world.  

As our country grapples with urgent questions about race and social justice, I have never been more certain that Yale’s approach to undergraduate admissions helps us to fulfill our mission to improve the world today and for future generations. We remain unwavering in our commitment to identifying applicants whose individual experiences and abilities will combine to create an extraordinary educational community.

Sincerely,

Dear students,

Although midterm isn't until October 23, the midpoint of the semester is nearly here now that the sixth of thirteen weeks of classes is ending. With the arrival quarantine period and the opening days now weeks behind us, I hope that you have been able to establish a healthy routine for managing schoolwork and make yourselves at home, whether you are living on campus or off.

These past few weeks of relative continuity have been an opportunity to form new habits while you have adjusted to the new learning environment. I know that many of you have been working hard to balance your obligations, and I hope that you have been able to communicate with your instructors or the many people who can help you if you need help or guidance from them. The Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning is another good resource, and it offers workshops that include managing a heavy reading load, working through procrastination, and building mentoring relationships.

This is a good time to shore up your good habits and strengthen your network of support, anticipating times in the weeks ahead where you might rely more heavily on them. Keep in mind, for example, that although the university’s COVID-19 numbers are very low, you might still need to isolate or quarantine if you test positive or come into contact with someone who does. Remember also that November will open with the general election, then end with the closing of campus residences, on November 21.

As you plan ahead for the coming six weeks, please do use the resources available through the Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning. But also remember to communicate with your residential college heads and deans, your advisers, the cultural center directors and assistant directors, peer liaisons, first-year counselors, coaches, chaplains, and your instructors. They are all here for you.

I know that many of you are also making plans for the end of the semester and also for the spring term. You will be receiving more information about both starting next week. In the meantime, I send you my best wishes for the coming weekend and the week ahead.

A Message from our COVID-19 Coordinator
 	 
	
Dear Members of the Yale Community,

Last week Yale changed its COVID-19 alert level to Green, and thanks to your continued vigilance, our campus has maintained a low rate of viral infection. The virus, however, does not respect boundaries, and we must remain aware of the state of the pandemic beyond Yale’s campus. We are observing increases in the number of new cases in many states around the country. Even in Connecticut, we are now seeing a rise in hospitalizations for COVID-19 and reports of local outbreaks. Many of the positive cases we have reported in our own Yale statistics appear to originate from exposures outside of our campus bounds. These statistics and reports underscore the fact that the virus is ever-present and we must continue to take all precautions—whether we are on or off campus--to prevent outbreaks at Yale and in our larger New Haven community.

Yale-sponsored gatherings
Our academic community is built on our connections with each other, yet we know that gatherings of people increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission and have frequently been the source of outbreaks. We have therefore designed guidelines for Yale-sponsored academic and social events and gatherings with the intention of supporting connection while reducing the risk of virus transmission. Students, faculty, staff and all Yale affiliates are expected to follow these guidelines and, more specifically, should consider the following key points when planning any events, including business meetings or social gatherings.

Only members of the Yale community authorized to be on campus may attend Yale sponsored events. 
Gatherings of ten (10) or fewer individuals without the advance approval of the relevant Dean, Head of College or Vice President, are permitted as long as the guidelines for events are observed. 
For events larger than ten (10) individuals, the event sponsor must apply to the school or department Health and Safety Leader using the application for approval form.
University limits for gatherings remain in place at 25 participants indoors and 100 participants outdoors and events and gatherings must meet all university occupancy limits for spaces.
Event sponsors should keep a record of participants to simplify contact tracing should the need arise.
Informal gatherings
Evidence indicates that there is a lower risk for transmission of COVID-19 outdoors than inside. The pleasant temperatures and mild conditions of fall offer wonderful opportunities to meet up with classmates and colleagues to enjoy outside activities. Outdoor games, like tossing a Frisbee, can be played if physical distance is maintained and objects are disinfected after each use. Walks to East Rock or town with a few friends are fine if established preventive measures are followed.

Please refer to Safe Campus Practices During the COVID-19 Pandemic for additional details.

A note about free expression and peaceable assembly
As we enter the election season amidst a global pandemic, it is important to remember that the university is committed to and supportive of the free expression of ideas, civic debate, and peaceable assembly. All members of our community should be mindful of health and safety practices as they engage in these activities. Students must comply with the Yale Community Compact and all measures to prevent COVID-19 transmission not only while on campus but also when engaging in off-campus activities in our neighboring community. Please refer to Guidance Regarding Free Expression and Peaceable Assembly for Students at Yale for further information.

I extend my deepest thanks to all who continue to gather and interact responsibly. Our collective attention to the wellbeing of our community is making an on-campus experience possible this semester. Let’s continue to meet this challenge.

Dear Members of the Yale Community,

Since becoming the president of Yale, I have had the opportunity to learn from your ideas, personal stories, and viewpoints on our strengths, weaknesses, and aspirations as a community. Through thousands of letters, emails, and conversations, you have expressed many recommendations for how we can continue to improve our campus environment and contribute knowledge and understanding to the world. You also have shared your anguish for the inequality, racism, and violence in U.S. society, which disproportionately affect members of Black and brown communities across the nation.

From your many voices, it became clear that we are connected by a need to improve the world, and we are a community that holds itself to high standards of acceptance, inclusion, and belonging. As members of a great research university, we recognize that we have a responsibility to use our individual expertise and the intellectual capacity of our institution to address longstanding challenges and injustices in our society and to continue advancing our university in ways that are essential to its excellence.

Change begins within our own community. Today, I am announcing the launch of programs that are part of the next phase of the Belonging at Yale initiative, which will delve into our history, assess and build on our current actions, support members of the university community, and create a stronger Yale for the future. Through these programs, we will ensure that we can continue to lead the way in teaching, research, scholarship, practice, and preservation of the highest caliber. All these activities require diverse strengths and a climate in which all members feel they belong and can thrive.

We designed these new initiatives based on your input and the recommendations of the President’s Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, which I formed in January. The committee was chaired by Kimberly Goff-Crews, university secretary and vice president for university life, and Gary Desir, vice provost for faculty development and diversity and Paul B. Beeson Professor of Medicine. I asked the members of this committee to recommend to me goals for the university, as well as strategies, actions, and assessment methods for achieving a more inclusive and equitable university environment. I am grateful to them for their work and their wisdom, and to all who consulted with them.  

The details of the programs I describe below build upon what many have done to bring Yale to this point. They mark the next phase of work to which we all must be committed for the long term, requiring perseverance and honest self-assessment. The excellence that we hope to achieve will not happen overnight, and we will need to adjust as we learn from our progress. Moreover, the president’s committee deliberated about a relatively short-term action plan, one stretching over the next three to five years, with the understanding that the work of diversity, inclusion, and belonging will extend for many years to come. What I am announcing here is part of necessary efforts to mitigate racism in society, which will require continuous hard work on many fronts, from education to research, from everyday campus operations to visionary new initiatives within our alumni and surrounding communities.

UNDERSTANDING YALE’S HISTORY

To understand where we are today and to move forward as a community, we must study the history of our university. As an American institution that is 319 years old, Yale has a complex past that includes associations, many of them formative, with individuals who actively promoted slavery, anti-Black racism, and other forms of exploitation. We have a responsibility to explore this history, including its most difficult aspects; we cannot ignore our institution's own ties to slavery and racism, and we should take this opportunity to research, understand, analyze, and communicate that history.

Professor David Blight, Sterling Professor of History, of African American Studies, and of American Studies, has agreed to lead a thorough examination of Yale’s historical entanglements with slavery and connections to abolition that will be made public for discussion, remembrance, memorialization, and learning. To complete this work, Professor Blight will use the resources of the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition, and reach out to scholars associated with the Department of African American Studies; the Department of History; the Program in Ethnicity, Race, and Migration; the Center for the Study of Race, Indigeneity, and Transnational Migration; and other units. A working group of faculty, staff, librarians, and community members is being organized to oversee the project. Several student research assistants will be enlisted to examine documents and materials in Yale archives and other research collections. The project will aim to complete its work and produce a written assessment by the end of the 2021 calendar year.

BUILDING ON CURRENT ACTIVITIES

Assessing our campus culture and the effectiveness of ongoing initiatives

Internal accountability for existing programs and organizational structures at Yale is key to identifying and combating our challenges. From increasing training focused on discrimination and harassment to advancing the diversity and excellence of the faculty and student body, the university has invested significantly in building and sustaining a community where everyone can thrive. To know whether we truly are making progress and whether we have created an environment that welcomes open discussion and debate among many different points of view, we must assess ourselves. I commit to transparency in tracking our progress in fostering a sense of belonging on campus and in preventing and addressing incidents of prejudice, racism, and discrimination.

I have asked the Office of the Provost, in consultation with the Office of the Secretary and Vice President for University Life, to create a method for assessing existing challenges and for identifying improvements in creating a culture of belonging on campus. The results will be shared with the community, and thus provide transparency about the status of our campus culture over time and help us direct resources where they are most needed.

I also will require all schools and departments to develop—as many already have—local DEI and belonging plans with specific direction to address the experience of staff, faculty, alumni, and students of color. Several offices will be involved in guiding how plans are structured, as well as developing a rubric for evaluating progress.

Shoring up financial aid for all students with need

Across our nation and around the world, a university education has long been a facilitator of social and economic mobility. In the past seven years, we nearly doubled the number of entering first-year students in Yale College who are eligible for Pell Grants and increased substantially those who are first in their families to attend college. We provided financial aid to over half of our undergraduates and enlarged the number of families whose financial contribution is zero.

As a result of our financial aid policies, approximately 85 percent of the Yale College Class of 2020 graduated debt free. We will protect the support we provide to undergraduates, especially those from the least affluent families, and build on what we have been able to achieve in the last half decade. We will continue to grow the resources available for need-based financial aid. We will raise additional gifts for scholarships. In the coming capital campaign, we will make providing funds to the endowment for financial aid a top priority, so that these resources are available in perpetuity.

We will examine every program that provides a pathway for those from marginalized populations to study and succeed at Yale, with the goal of ensuring it is fully accessible and maximally effective. I am asking the Yale College Dean’s Office to consider an expansion of the Eli Whitney Scholars Program, approaches to transfer applicants from community colleges who would like to study in Yale College, and the First-year Scholars Program, as a start. We will also staunchly defend Yale’s admissions policies against the U.S. Department of Justice’s efforts to reverse the progress that we have made toward a more diverse student body. Our admissions policies fully comply with the law, and we have determined—as an institution of highly experienced teachers and scholars—that they improve the education that we offer our students.     

In addition, we need to do more to address the high levels of debt among students graduating from some of our professional schools. I will make it a special focus to seek funds for financial aid in the fields that are least remunerative, such as public health, nursing, divinity, environment, and the arts.

New centers for research and scholarship

Yale is a thriving center of world-leading scholarship and research in fields relevant to addressing racism. The university has invested in this work for some time. Our Department of African American Studies was the first of its kind. The Gilder-Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition and the Center for the Study of Race, Indigeneity, and Transnational Migration are unique sources of vital scholarship. Last year, we bolstered support for the Program in Ethnicity, Race, and Migration. Other centers of related work, such as the Law School’s Justice Collaboratory, continue to generate excellent scholarship and inspiring teaching as well.  

Because Yale has several centers, programs, and departments working in this crucial interdisciplinary space, I have asked Vice Provost Gary Desir to convene their leaders to determine the best ways to ensure high levels of collaboration and project prioritization among them. Scholarly activities should be coordinated and have the greatest possible impact. 

In addition to the established units committed to the study of race and ethnicity, we will develop a new center this year: The Center for Law and Racial Justice. Headquartered in the Yale Law School and directed by J. Skelly Wright Professor of Law James Forman Jr., the Center for Law and Racial Justice will be a hub for teaching, research, and policy work on legal aspects of racial justice, oriented around a successful pedagogical model of turning classrooms “inside out” and enabling students to learn by doing.

I also am delighted to report that Professor Phillip Atiba Goff, an expert on the social psychology of criminal justice, has joined our faculty. He holds appointments in the Departments of African American Studies and Psychology and brings with him to New Haven his well-known Center for Policing Equity.

I here mention only a small number of the academic leaders at Yale committed to this intellectual work. Our faculty, staff, students, and alumni can learn from the research and teaching in these centers, as well as in other academic units with award-winning educators and scholars. To this end, we will deploy the Office of Public Affairs and Communications to amplify faculty research in these and related areas so that the work can benefit the public.

MAKING YALE MORE WELCOMING

A new commitment to develop and retain an excellent and diverse faculty

A diverse faculty is a cornerstone of our university’s excellence. Everything we aspire to do flows from our ability to find great new scholars and bring them to Yale. To mentor well, teach skillfully, and stretch the boundaries of the intellectual frontier depend entirely on bringing new people from all backgrounds and experiences to our campus.

In 2015, we launched the Faculty Excellence and Diversity Initiative (FEDI), pledging $50 million to be used over five years to improve the excellence and diversity of Yale’s faculty as well as the academic pipeline. In the first five years of FEDI, Yale recruited 101 faculty members and supported 43 visiting fellows, 101 graduate students, and 25 post-baccalaureate fellowships for recent college graduates. Last fall, we extended FEDI for another half decade with an additional $85 million commitment. Recognizing that having excellence and diversity in our tenured faculty ranks is an issue of importance, the FEDI renewal includes support for recruiting senior faculty members. We reaffirm this expanded commitment to FEDI. With this action, Yale makes an emphatic statement about welcoming the most distinguished scholars to our campus to strengthen and help diversify the university. Moreover, resources from FEDI can be used in creative ways—such as to support cluster hires—to build strength in key areas.

However, hiring excellent and diverse faculty is not enough. Yale must welcome them and develop their careers in ways that provide the best chances for long-term success and retention. I am therefore asking deans and department chairs to evaluate the current state of mentoring programs for instructional, research, and ladder-track faculty and enhance them wherever necessary. We will ensure that faculty have the formal mentors who will advocate for them in their careers and help create plans for their advancement. School and department leaders will be accountable to Provost Scott Strobel and Vice Provost Gary Desir for the effectiveness of these efforts.

Yale also is committed to expanding the pipeline of scholars who will join the ranks of faculty in the future. We already have Mellon Mays Fellows and Edward A. Bouchet Fellows programs for undergraduates, and the Emerging Scholars Initiative in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. I am now announcing two additional enhancements to strengthen these critical efforts. First, we will arrange systematic outreach to and recruitment of graduates from historically Black and minority-serving colleges and universities as well as tribal colleges to our professional school programs, as we already do for the graduate school. Second, we will offer focused educational programs and mentorship to postdoctoral scholars at Yale, so that they can be prepared better to be hired on to college and university faculties throughout the country.  

Transforming public safety and policing

Our community is home to the oldest university police force in the country, and we aspire to lead the way in transforming policing on college campuses. We started this work last fall, when we engaged a team of recognized experts on public safety, 21CP Solutions, to conduct a comprehensive assessment of our campus police department. After holding in-depth listening sessions with community and campus stakeholders and analyzing existing policing practices, they produced a report that has helped us to take a series of initial actions. For example, we are discouraging a police response to calls that would be addressed better by trained mental health, student life, and counseling professionals, and we are conducting new scenario-based training in de-escalation techniques and reduction of the use of force. We also are reporting annually all instances when Yale police officers use force.

Our work here has just begun. I have asked Senior Vice President Jack Callahan; Kerwin Charles, Indra K. Nooyi Dean of the Yale School of Management; Lauren Zucker, associate vice president for New Haven affairs and university properties; and Secretary and Vice President Kimberly Goff-Crews to make suggestions to me regarding the continued implementation of the 21CP recommendations and beyond. I am asking them to work closely with Chief of Police Ronnell Higgins to review quantitative and descriptive data from the Yale Police Department and on policing more generally, solicit input from members of the Yale and broader community, and analyze how other communities have approached police reform. This group will consider the mission and goals of the Yale Police Department and ensure that our current operations and policies are aligned with them. The members of this task force and I will also confer with campus experts on policing and racial injustice to seek their advice on university policing for the future. Our dedicated and hardworking officers deserve our full engagement in helping them protect and serve our community.

Increasing the diversity among top staff leaders

The percentage of Yale managers and professionals from historically underrepresented minority groups has more than doubled in the past decade. However, at the top levels of university leadership, we have much more work to do.

It is well demonstrated in the literature on organizational behavior that diverse teams, with respect to members’ backgrounds, beliefs, and life experiences, make better decisions than those that are more homogeneous. We will continue to seek applications from individuals who will bring greater diversity to the university’s leadership when hiring for vice presidents, deans, and other key positions. We will work hard so that short lists for these positions include candidates who would bring additional diversity to Yale.

To develop the pipeline to leadership further, I have launched a Staff Leadership Initiative. At the end of every academic year, starting with this one, I will ask each dean and unit leader at Yale to nominate high-potential staff members, including those who would bring excellence and diversity to the leadership ranks, to participate in an early- and mid-career development program with the goal of strengthening their qualifications for promotion to leadership positions including senior management. Participants should come from across the university. The program will be developed with experts from the School of Management and will involve mentorship, training, the creation of a career ladder, and the opportunity to work on a project with a university leader.

Working with our alumni community

Our alumni have long supported a more diverse and welcoming campus community. In the past five years, the Yale Alumni Association (YAA) has prioritized diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. Now, expanding its virtual presence in new ways—such as the recent launch of the Cross Campus platform for mentorship and community-building among alumni and students—the association will make DEI and belonging key thematic areas in its programming, supporting career and professional development and lifelong learning that will promote understanding and inspire action and service.

At the second biennial Impact Conference in March 2021, faculty, other experts, and alumni will focus on DEI and belonging and their relationships to social justice and action in their communities. The YAA will work with alumni shared identity groups to help them build strong connections with student organizations, campus leaders, and university centers and offices. These direct connections will expand the YAA’s mentoring and networking programs for students, facilitate alumni support of first-generation and low-income students, and provide role models of alumni leadership. The YAA will also arrange facilitated and other types of conversations among alumni from diverse backgrounds to encourage learning and understanding through the sharing of personal stories. Finally, as part of a plan to build a strong alumni leadership pipeline, the YAA will develop connections with students and recent graduates from historically underrepresented groups to ensure their voices are heard and to explore their interest in leadership service.

Increasing diversity of contractors, vendors, and business professionals and other community partnerships

A new program under the leadership of Susannah Gobbi, the university’s chief procurement officer, and John Bollier, vice president for facilities and campus development, will reach out to minority-owned businesses in the New Haven community to ensure that they are aware of opportunities and encouraged to bid on university contracts for goods and services. The changes will support the New Haven community, especially businesses suffering under the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yale will continue to partner with the City of New Haven to promote economic development and job creation, public safety, educational opportunity, home ownership, and wellness. And we will continue to work with New Haven retailers who rent university-owned spaces to help them withstand the impact of the pandemic on their revenues.

The New Haven Promise program provides scholarships, funded by Yale, to all graduates of New Haven public high schools meeting certain criteria to be used to pursue a college education anywhere in the state. Yale currently budgets $4 million each year for this program, and we will increase this allocation in future years to continue to fund all eligible students.  

***

The engagement and feedback of every one of us will be critical to the success of these initiatives to change Yale for the better. We can remain a great university only if we are tireless in seeking ways to improve every aspect of campus life and operations, encourage participation by people of all backgrounds, and foster a sense of belonging. Your input will be needed as we continue to improve existing programs and pursue new ones. Thank you for joining hands and strengthening our university.

Dear students in the New Haven area,

Earlier tonight, Dr. Stephanie Spangler alerted the community to six linked COVID-19 cases that have emerged in the undergraduate community. I urge you to read her message if you have not already, and to redouble your efforts to protect the community’s health as well as your own.

As Dr. Spangler described, the students who tested positive, all of them members of a varsity athletics team, have gone into isolation, and others have begun to quarantine. Dr. Spangler, together with Yale Health, Yale Athletics, and others, has worked to reduce the chances that this COVID cluster will spread. In addition to the standard contact tracing and quarantining of close contacts, the entire team has gone into quarantine, along with the staff members who work closely with them. All in-person varsity practices have been suspended, and Payne Whitney Gymnasium has been closed, while further testing is underway. These steps may ultimately prove unnecessary—at this time, there is no evidence of widespread infection—but this is a time for caution. I am grateful to everyone for their decisive actions, and especially to the affected students for their cooperation.

While the Athletics community is leading the response, we all have a role to play in safeguarding our community. We can minimize the impact of this COVID cluster by scrupulously following the public health guidelines: cover your face, wash your hands, and maintain social distance from everyone outside of your suite, apartment, or house. Fill out the daily health check and call the Campus COVID Resource Line (203-432-6604) if you have symptoms. And, please, stay on top of your testing; this is vital. Those of you enrolled in residence must test twice weekly—this routine testing made it possible to identify the COVID cluster and take immediate protective action. Those of you enrolled remotely or on leave may participate in optional weekly testing, and I hope you will—this helps protect your own health and that of everyone around you. All of you can make your appointments at covidtesting.yale.edu.

The COVID-19 virus spreads easily, but by taking these simple actions we considerably reduce the risk of transmission. I ask you to join with me in working together to protect everyone’s health.

Sincerely,

Marvin M. Chun
Dean of Yale College

A Message from our COVID-19 Coordinator
 	 
	
Dear Members of the Yale Community,

I am writing to make you aware that, through our COVID-19 testing program, we have identified a small cluster of cases among undergraduates, and to share with you the steps we are taking to address this situation. I am not writing to raise alarm, but rather because this situation serves as a reminder that the virus is present in our community, and we need to continue to rigorously follow all of our health and safety measures.

Certain health data collected in the course of Yale’s COVID-related programs are subject to federal and state privacy regulations. Accordingly, while I intend to provide helpful information in the summary that follows, I must at the same time adhere to these regulations and protect the privacy of individual community members.

Over the past 24 hours, the university has learned of six positive cases of COVID-19 among students, living on and off campus, who are members of the same varsity athletic team. These cases were identified through our twice-weekly screening program, and the university’s testing and tracing team acted quickly upon receiving the positive test results--isolating the infected individuals and initiating contact tracing to identify and quarantine their close contacts. While we continue to watch carefully for any further developments and investigate the possible sources of the outbreak, the university has implemented a number of additional cautionary measures:

All members of the affected team who are presently in New Haven, as well as the Athletics staff who work directly with them, have been asked to quarantine and participate in the testing program, whether or not they are identified as close contacts through the contact tracing program;
All varsity athletic teams and intramural programs will cease in-person training activities for at least the coming week; and
Certain athletic facilities, including Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Ingalls Rink, and the Cullman-Heyman Tennis Center, will be closed for cleaning until Monday, October 19, 2020.
If we learn more about the origins and evolution of this situation, I will keep you informed of any information that is important to the community’s health and well-being. In the meantime, please remember that our Campus COVID Resource Line (203-432-6604) is available to anyone who has questions or concerns.

We have now passed the halfway point of our fall semester. In order to finish as strongly as we started, we must remain vigilant and continue to observe all health and safety measures. Thank you all for your sustained commitment and partnership.

Sincerely,

Stephanie S. Spangler, M.D.

October 13, 2020

Dear Members of the Yale Community,

We began this academic year with unique awareness of the ways we are interdependent and of how our studies and work have impact well beyond our campus community. In these extraordinary times, we understand, perhaps better than ever before, that we have an obligation to create knowledge, discover new ways of understanding, and demonstrate the importance of taking action rooted in research and scholarship, indeed, in light and truth. Although we all have been focused on doing our part to prevent the spread of COVID-19, activity has continued across campus to realize the university’s top priorities and sustain our mission.

Today, I write to provide an update on our academic strategy, the investments we are making to strengthen our university and, more importantly, to address pressing challenges and prepare the next generation to serve and lead in a world of growing complexity. These investments, which were first delineated in my memo of November 2016, include sciences and engineering; empirical, policy-relevant social science research; arts and humanities; and support for faculty and students.

Sciences and Engineering
Science and Engineering photo collage
Across our campus, we are emphasizing Yale’s commitment to sciences and engineering to spark discoveries that can improve lives. Our strategy is targeted and reflects some of Yale’s particular research strengths from Science Hill to the School of Medicine, from central campus to the West Campus. As you recall, we especially are focused on five multidisciplinary areas (as well as a number of other cross-cutting initiatives) where Yale can build on excellence, enhance our global reputation, and have outsized impact: data science and computer science; neuroscience; inflammation science; planetary solutions; and quantum science, engineering, and materials.

Data science and computer science: The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the importance of big data, computational tools, and other mathematical and technological developments in monitoring the spread and effects of disease. Of course, this priority area extends well beyond medicine and public health. It touches nearly every discipline and can benefit research throughout our campus. We are expanding data science and computer science in their applications, and we are advancing fundamental research underlying these areas too. This year, we are moving forward with the Kline Tower project, which had been put on hold in the spring due to the pandemic. We will create a state-of-the-art building that will transform the pursuit of data science, statistics, mathematics, and astronomy at Yale. We will begin interior demolition this month and complete the project by 2023.

Neuroscience: Yale has extraordinary strengths in neuroscience across many departments, programs, and schools. We are leveraging our faculty’s diverse expertise and research foci to expand the frontiers of knowledge, from molecular and cellular neuroscience to organismal cognition and behavior. We are advancing our understanding of the human mind, including how it functions and how it can be repaired. This academic year, we will finalize plans for a neuroscience institute at 100 College Street. Many faculty members who work in neuroscience and related fields from various disciplines will move into this new space in summer 2022.

Inflammation science: Inflammation science is vital to understanding our immune system as well as the cause and role of inflammation in many illnesses, including COVID-19, arthritis, cancer, depression, and multiple sclerosis. Yale has preeminent investigators working across the basic, translational, and clinical sciences to study inflammation and apply these discoveries to preventing, treating, and curing diseases. This year, Provost Scott Strobel and School of Medicine Dean Nancy Brown will work with colleagues across campus to develop ways to bring together multidisciplinary teams of faculty members to accelerate work that offers insights into the underlying causes of inflammation and its role in a wide range of conditions.

Planetary solutions: People around the globe are experiencing the clearly evident effects of climate change: forest fires across the western United States, a heat wave in Siberia, record high temperatures in the Arctic, and increasingly stronger hurricanes forming over the Atlantic Ocean. Climate change is a longstanding threat to humanity, and we must remain focused on creating solutions for this crisis. Yale’s Planetary Solutions Project addresses climate change and the evolutionary response to it. This is an area of focus throughout the university—from the School of Architecture to the School of the Environment, from economics to sociology and throughout the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Later this semester, Provost Strobel will convene faculty members—in the arts, humanities, social sciences, sciences, and engineering—who work on projects related to Planetary Solutions, at various levels of analysis, from basic science to public policy. He will work with colleagues to implement a strategy to draw on research and scholarship across our campus to address the threats to our local and global environment.

Quantum science, engineering, and materials: Investments in this exciting area augment Yale’s indisputable leadership in quantum research, which could revolutionize technological developments across every sector. The Department of Energy recently selected Yale faculty members to lead the Co-design Center for Quantum Advantage, and Yale is one of the few universities that has a faculty member on the National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee. These tremendous honors recognize our university’s preeminence in quantum science and computing. We are committed to building on this strength for Yale and the country. We are currently planning a physical sciences and engineering building to house quantum science, engineering, and materials research groups and many others in related fields on Science Hill.

Since my last update, more investigators and students have moved into the Yale Science Building, a major milestone in the university’s historic push in research, on Science Hill. Already, this facility houses thirty research groups conducting studies and forming new collaborations to answer questions about viruses, neural networks, genetic coding, insect behavior, environmental and climate stresses on plants, among many areas of investigation. Their work, which intersects with several priority areas, provides vital information about biological processes and the environment.

Empirical, Policy-Relevant Social Science Research
The Kerry Initiative
The COVID-19 pandemic reveals the wide-ranging consequences of a truly global disruption. It has demonstrated that we must collaborate across fields and disciplines and engage with the world through empirical research to inform policy that makes a positive difference in our communities.

The Yale Jackson Institute
Our strategy in this priority area is to emphasize multidisciplinary social science research that addresses the great issues of the day, such as health care delivery, inequality, migration, and polarization. The soon-to-be-established Yale Jackson School of Global Affairs, for example, will bring together scholars, policymakers, and practitioners working on critical issues that affect people and governments around the world. The Yale Jackson School will open once we have completed raising the endowment for it. We are over three-quarters of the way there now and expect to reach this milestone in the fall of 2022. It will be the first school created at Yale since the School of Management in 1976.

We also are emphasizing the importance of social science research that addresses domestic public policy. This focus allows Yale to offer data-informed solutions, rather than partisanship or anecdotal evidence, to advance society. The new Tobin Center for Economic Policy is part of Yale’s commitment to conducting evidence-based research to solve critical challenges. In recent months, faculty members of the Tobin Center have been studying and discussing with policymakers the economic factors involved in reopening commercial activities responsibly. Research and analysis are also underway on policy and economic barriers to the production of COVID-19 tests and on stresses facing labor markets, small businesses, child care, and the hourly workforce during the pandemic.

During this academic year, Provost Strobel and I will be looking for opportunities to support faculty research and curricular and programmatic enhancements that provide students with more opportunities to develop fundamental knowledge and skills in the data-intensive social sciences and in policy-relevant social science more generally. We are also planning infrastructure projects—such as the creation of a secure data handling site—that can support such research. Of course, there are obvious benefits to building faculty connections between the social sciences and data science and computer science, so we will be encouraging such collaborations.

Arts and Humanities
In recent months, we have grappled not only with the pandemic but also the salience and consequences of inequality, racism, and violence. These challenges create an especially compelling context for the kind of critical analysis encouraged by humanities scholarship and teaching as well as the reflection, inspiration, and hope the arts stimulate in each of us. We have never needed the arts and humanities more to ask questions about our world and our place in it. Like Yale scholars from previous generations, current faculty and students motivate us to engage with deep-rooted difficulties in society and help us make sense of both everyday events and momentous disruptions.

Rendering of 320 York Street
Today, we are deepening Yale’s historic preeminence in the humanities. The renovation and expansion of 320 York Street—the Humanities Quadrangle—is nearly complete. It will bring together many humanities departments, along with signature programs like Directed Studies and the Whitney Humanities Center. By encouraging scholarship across disciplines, we will accelerate our ability to ask and answer key questions about ourselves and the world. The Humanities Quadrangle will open in December of this year. This spectacular building at the heart of campus represents the centrality of the humanities to Yale. It will be a home worthy of our preeminent scholars.

Yale University Art Gallery
We also will develop new areas in teaching and scholarship, such as through our museums and other collections, among the finest in the world. In addition, I am focused on creating new professorships that bridge the arts to other parts of the university, so Yale can continue to set the standard in these areas.

Support for Faculty and Students
Kroon Hall outdoor classroom
All the academic investments support the work of our faculty members, who define Yale and are the university’s greatest strength. In recent years, we have recruited and retained exceptional educators and scholars across each of our academic priority areas and beyond. In fact, despite challenges brought on by the public health crisis, the past academic year was one of the most successful for faculty recruitment related to the academic strategy. In the coming year, we will continue to support targeted hiring of field-changing faculty.

We also have focused on maintaining the excellence of our student body and on fostering a diverse and exceptional educational community. Today, our students hail from over 120 countries and from every conceivable walk of life. They bring their unique experiences and dreams to our campus. They transform Yale and are transformed by it. That is why we remain committed to financial aid across the university and are making a significant investment in talented students. Between 2013 and 2019, we nearly doubled the number of entering first-year undergraduates who are eligible for Pell Grants, and increased significantly those who are first in their families to attend college.

Tsai Center for Innovative Thinking
In addition, we have been cultivating innovative, multidisciplinary thinking among all our students. The Yale innovation corridor—including the Tsai Center for Innovative Thinking at Yale (Tsai CITY), the Yale Center for Engineering Innovation and Design (CEID), and the Greenberg Engineering Teaching Concourse—brings students throughout the university together to create new ventures and address challenges across sectors. The building for Tsai CITY is complete and will open once the pandemic is over; however, we have already launched its programs. Tsai CITY is now working with students to catalyze over 100 projects per year.

Rendering of the Schwarzman Center
Construction of the Schwarzman Center will be completed in December 2020, and when the building opens in 2021, it will play a vital role, ultimately, in helping us reengage with the activities that are not possible during this public health crisis. Once it is safe to gather again, our entire community will be enriched by in-person artistic performances, guest lectures, and many other events. The Schwarzman Center will strengthen connections among undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students; faculty members; alumni; and our neighbors in New Haven. Prior to its physical opening, the center is offering unique digital programming that showcases the work of students, as well as collaborative arts experiences with organizations and artists in the wider community.

I will soon announce, separately, new initiatives to foster and sustain a campus culture that attracts, inspires, and supports the finest and most committed faculty members and students from every background, every neighborhood in this country, and every part of the world. A diverse faculty and student body—who are fully included in the Yale community—form the foundation for everything we do at Yale. We will work across many fronts to achieve a university environment where everyone belongs and can thrive, so that we can continue to teach and conduct research and scholarship of the highest caliber.

* * *
The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us of how quickly unexpected trials may alter our lives. We must do our part in building a more resilient society by empowering groundbreaking scientific discoveries, remaining a radiant center of humanistic scholarship and artistic expression, and maintaining a vibrant home for the kind of multidisciplinary collaboration that addresses national and global problems. We also must open our doors wider as we prepare leaders who will serve all sectors of society throughout the world.

We have a lot to do, and together, we will lay the foundation for an even stronger future. I look forward to the work ahead and to the next opportunity to update you on our progress.

With best wishes for your continued health and safety,
